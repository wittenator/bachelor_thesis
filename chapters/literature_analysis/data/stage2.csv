The final phase is important because it can provide a trained connectionist architecture with explanation power and validate its output decisions. Moreover, it can be used to refine and maintain the initial knowledge acquired from domain experts. In this paper, we present three rule extraction techniques. The first technique extracts a set of binary rules from any type of neural network. The other two techniques are specific to feedforward networks, with a single hidden layer of sigmoidal units. Technique 2 extracts partial rules that represent the most important embedded knowledge with an adjustable level of detail, while the third technique provides a more comprehensive and universal approach. A rule-evaluation technique, which orders extracted rules based on three performance measures, is then proposed. The three techniques area applied to the iris and breast cancer data sets. The extracted rules are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively, and are compared with those obtained by other approaches.","1999-05","2019-09-20 10:15:31","2019-09-20 10:15:31","","448-463","","3","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: 774103  bibtex*[comments=Presents a specific method for enhancing explainability for models,]","","","","adjustable detail level; artificial neural networks; Artificial neural networks; binary rules; breast cancer data set; Computer networks; connectionist architecture; Data mining; domain knowledge mapping; domain knowledge representation; embedded knowledge; explanation; explanation power; feedforward networks; feedforward neural nets; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy sets; hidden layer; hybrid intelligent systems; Intelligent systems; iris data set; knowledge based systems; Knowledge based systems; knowledge refinement; knowledge representation; Knowledge representation; knowledge-based systems; learning (artificial intelligence); Military computing; network training; neural net architecture; Neural networks; output decision validation; partial rules; performance measures; rule evaluation technique; rule extraction; rule ordering; sigmoidal units; symbol manipulation; symbolic interpretation; truth maintenance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present TNNVis, a visualization system that supports un-derstanding of deep neural networks specifically designed to analyze text. TNNVis focuses on DNNs composed of fully connected and convolutional layers. It integrates visual encodings and interaction techniques chosen specifically for our tasks. The tool allows users to: (1) visually explore DNN models with arbitrary input using a combination of node-link diagrams and matrix representation; (2) quickly identify activation values, weights, and feature map patterns within a network; (3) flexibly focus on visual information of interest with threshold, inspection, insight query, and tooltip operations; (4) discover network activation and training patterns through animation; and (5) compare differences between internal activation patterns for different inputs to the DNN. These functions allow neural network researchers to examine their DNN models from new perspectives, producing insights on how these models function. Clustering and summarization techniques are employed to support large convolutional and fully connected layers. Based on several part of speech models with different structure and size, we present multiple use cases where visualization facilitates an understanding of the models.","2018-04","2019-09-20 10:15:32","2019-09-20 10:15:32","","180-189","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: 8365991  bibtex*[comments=Presents a specific method for enhancing explainability for models,]  ISSN: 2165-8773","","","","Biological neural networks; clustering techniques; Computational modeling; convolutional connected layers; convolutional layers; Convolutional neural networks; data visualisation; deep learning; deep neural networks; DNN models; DNNs; feedforward neural nets; fully connected layers; human centered computing; information visualization; interaction techniques; internal activation patterns; learning (artificial intelligence); machine learning; natural language processing; network activation; neural network researchers; Neurons; speech models; summarization techniques; Task analysis; text analysis; text analytics; TNNVis; training patterns; visual encodings; Visualization; visualization design; visualization system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a large number of potential but neglected users are the domain experts with little knowledge of machine learning but are expected to work with machine learning systems. In this paper, we present an interactive visualization technique to help users with little expertise in machine learning to understand, explore and validate predictive models. By viewing the model as a black box, we extract a standardized rule-based knowledge representation from its input-output behavior.

We present Manifold, a framework that utilizes visual analysis techniques to support interpretation, debugging, and comparison of machine learning models in a more transparent and interactive manner. Conventional techniques usually focus on visualizing the internal logic of a specific model type (i.e., deep neural networks), lacking the ability to extend to a more complex scenario where different model types are integrated. To this end, Manifold is designed as a generic framework that does not rely on or access the internal logic of the model and solely observes the input (i.e., instances or features) and the output (i.e., the predicted result and probability distribution). We describe the workflow of Manifold as an iterative process consisting of three major phases that are commonly involved in the model development and diagnosis process: inspection (hypothesis), explanation (reasoning), and refinement (verification). The visual components supporting these tasks include a scatterplot-based visual summary that overviews the models' outcome and a customizable tabular view that reveals feature discrimination. We demonstrate current applications of the framework on the classification and regression tasks and discuss other potential machine learning use scenarios where Manifold can be applied.","2019-01","2019-09-20 10:15:32","2019-09-20 10:15:32","","364-373","","1","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: 8440091  bibtex*[comments=Presents a specific method for enhancing explainability for models,]","","","","Analytical models; classification tasks; Computational modeling; customizable tabular view; data analysis; Data models; data visualisation; debugging; deep neural networks; diagnosis process; explanation; feature discrimination; generic framework; inspection; Interactive machine learning; internal logic; interpretation; iterative methods; learning (artificial intelligence); Machine learning; machine learning models; manifold; Manifolds; model comparison; model debugging; model development; model-agnostic framework; models outcome; neural nets; performance analysis; potential machine learning; refinement; regression analysis; regression tasks; scatterplot-based visual summary; specific model type; Task analysis; visual analysis techniques; Visualization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI.

In deep learning, neural networks have a very complex and deep structure and it is difficult to discuss why they work well or not. So you have to take a trial-and-error to improve their performances. We develop a mechanism to show how neural networks predict final results and help you to design a new neural network architecture based on its prediction criteria. Speaking concrete, we visualize important features to predict the final results with an attentional mechanism. In this paper, we take up sentient analysis, which is one of natural language processing tasks. In image processing visualizing weights of a neural network is a major approach and you can obtain intuitive results; object outlines and object components. However, in natural language processing, the approach is not interpretable because a discriminate function constructed by a neural network is a complex and nonlinear one and it is very difficult to correlate weights and words in a text. We employ Gated Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) and introduce a self-attention mechanism to understand how GCNN determines sentiment polarities from raw reviews. GCNN can simulate an n-gram model and the self-attention mechanism can make correspondence between weights of a neural network and words clear. In experiments, we used Amazon reviews and evaluated the performance of the proposed method. Especially, the proposed method was able to emphasize some words in the review to determine sentiment polarity. Moreover, when the prediction was wrong, we were able to understand why the proposed method made mistakes because we found what words the proposed method emphasized.","2018-12","2019-09-20 10:15:34","2019-09-20 10:15:34","","77-82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: 8614007  bibtex*[comments=Presents a specific method for enhancing explainability for models,]","","","","Amazon reviews; attention visualization; convolutional neural nets; Convolutional neural networks; deep learning; Deep learning; Gated CNN; gated convolutional neural networks; GCNN; Kernel; learning (artificial intelligence); Logic gates; natural language processing; Natural language processing; neural net architecture; neural network architecture; self-attention mechanism; sentient analysis; sentiment analysis; Sentiment analysis; Task analysis; the self-attention mechanism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When documents are staged for review - where they are typically assessed for relevancy or privilege - the process can require companies to dedicate an extraordinary level of resources, both with respect to human resources, but also with respect to the use of technology-based techniques to intelligently sift through data. Companies regularly spend millions of dollars producing `responsive' electronically-stored documents for these types of matters. For several years, attorneys have been using a variety of tools to conduct this exercise, and most recently, they are accepting the use of machine learning techniques like text classification (referred to as predictive coding in the legal industry) to efficiently cull massive volumes of data to identify responsive documents for use in these matters. In recent years, a group of AI and Machine Learning researchers have been actively researching Explainable AI. In an explainable AI system, actions or decisions are human understandable. In typical legal `document review' scenarios, a document can be identified as responsive, as long as one or more of the text snippets (small passages of text) in a document are deemed responsive. In these scenarios, if predictive coding can be used to locate these responsive snippets, then attorneys could easily evaluate the model's document classification decision. When deployed with defined and explainable results, predictive coding can drastically enhance the overall quality and speed of the document review process by reducing the time it takes to review documents. Moreover, explainable predictive coding provides lawyers with greater confidence in the results of that supervised learning task. The authors of this paper propose the concept of explainable predictive coding and simple explainable predictive coding methods to locate responsive snippets within responsive documents. We also report our preliminary experimental results using the data from an actual legal matter that entailed this type of document review. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of explainable predictive coding in the context of professional services in the legal space.","2018-12","2019-09-20 10:15:34","2019-09-20 10:15:34","","1905-1911","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: 8622073  bibtex*[comments=Presents a specific method for enhancing explainability for models,]","","","","data-focused engagements; document classification; electronically-stored documents; explainable AI; explainable AI system; explainable predictive coding; explainable predictive coding methods; Law; law administration; legal document review; machine learning; Machine learning; machine learning researchers; pattern classification; predictive coding; Predictive coding; Predictive models; responsive documents; responsive snippets; supervised learning; supervised learning task; technology-based techniques; text analysis; text categorization; Text categorization; text classification; typical legal document review scenarios","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To tackle this challenge, model interpretability is essential and has been investigated in a wide range of applications. For end users, model interpretability can be used to build trust in the deployed machine learning models. For practitioners, interpretability plays a critical role in model explanation, model validation, and model improvement to develop a faithful model. In the paper, we propose a novel Multi-scale INTerpretation (MINT) model for convolutional neural networks using both the perturbation-based and the gradient-based interpretation approaches. It learns the class-discriminative interpretable knowledge from the multi-scale perturbation of feature information in different layers of deep networks. The proposed MINT model provides the coarse-scale and the fine-scale interpretations for the attention in the deep layer and specific features in the shallow layer, respectively. Experimental results show that the MINT model presents the class-discriminative interpretation of the network decision and explains the significance of the hierarchical network structure.","2019","2019-09-20 10:15:34","2019-09-20 10:15:34","","1-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: 8653995  bibtex*[comments=Presents a specific method for enhancing explainability for models,]","","","","Analytical models; Computational modeling; convolutional neural networks; Feature extraction; Heating systems; Image segmentation; Model interpretability; model-agnostic; multi-scale interpretation; Perturbation methods; Visualization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most of the real tasks don't have enough labeled data to train each complex model. To solve this problem, transfer learning reuses the pretrained model on a new task. However, one weakness of transfer learning is that it applies a pretrained model to a new task without understanding the output of an existing model. This may cause a lack of interpretability in training deep neural network. In this paper, we propose a technique to improve the interpretability in transfer learning tasks. We define the interpretable features and use it to train model to a new task. Thus, we will be able to explain the relationship between the source and target domain in a transfer learning task. Feature Network (FN) consists of Feature Extraction Layer and a single mapping layer that connects the features extracted from the source domain to the target domain.

Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.","2016-02","2019-09-20 10:15:37","2019-09-20 10:15:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938v3  bibtex*[comments=Reviews the current state of explainability research,]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, interpretability has become a vital concern in machine learning, and work in the area of interpretable models has found renewed interest. In some applications, such models are as accurate as non-interpretable ones, and thus are preferred for their transparency. Even when they are not accurate, they may still be preferred when interpretability is of paramount importance. However, restricting machine learning to interpretable models is often a severe limitation. In this paper we argue for explaining machine learning predictions using model-agnostic approaches. By treating the machine learning models as black-box functions, these approaches provide crucial flexibility in the choice of models, explanations, and representations, improving debugging, comparison, and interfaces for a variety of users and models.

Specifically, we are interested in finding what part of the input (pixels in images or words in questions) the VQA model focuses on while answering the question. To tackle this problem, we use two visualization techniques – guided backpropagation and occlusion – to find important words in the question and important regions in the image.

However, high prediction accuracies are not the only objective to consider when solving problems using machine learning. Instead, particular scientific applications require some explanation of the learned prediction function. Unfortunately, most methods do not come with out of the box straight forward interpretation. Even linear prediction functions are not straight forward to explain if features exhibit complex correlation structure. In this paper, we propose the Measure of Feature Importance (MFI). MFI is general and can be applied to any arbitrary learning machine (including kernel machines and deep learning). MFI is intrinsically non-linear and can detect features that by itself are inconspicuous and only impact the prediction function through their interaction with other features.

Machine learning (ML) models have been trained to automatically map documents to these abstract concepts, allowing to annotate very large text collections, more than could be processed by a human in a lifetime. Besides predicting the text's category very accurately, it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the categorization process takes place. In this paper, we demonstrate that such understanding can be achieved by tracing the classification decision back to individual words using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), a recently developed technique for explaining predictions of complex non-linear classifiers. We train two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, on a topic categorization task and adapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words. Resulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall classification decision. This enables one to distill relevant information from text documents without an explicit semantic information extraction step. We further use the word-wise relevance scores for generating novel vector-based document representations which capture semantic information. Based on these document vectors, we introduce a measure of model explanatory power and show that, although the SVM and CNN models perform similarly in terms of classification accuracy, the latter exhibits a higher level of explainability which makes it more comprehensible for humans and potentially more useful for other applications.","2016-12","2019-09-20 10:15:38","2019-09-20 10:15:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07843v1  bibtex*[comments=Presents a specific method for enhancing explainability for models,]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These deep models often suffer from a lack of interpretability – they are particularly difficult to understand because of their non-linear nature. As a result, neural networks are often treated as ""black box"" models, and in the past, have been trained purely to optimize the accuracy of predictions. In this work, we create a novel network architecture for deep learning that naturally explains its own reasoning for each prediction. This architecture contains an autoencoder and a special prototype layer, where each unit of that layer stores a weight vector that resembles an encoded training input. The encoder of the autoencoder allows us to do comparisons within the latent space, while the decoder allows us to visualize the learned prototypes. The training objective has four terms: an accuracy term, a term that encourages every prototype to be similar to at least one encoded input, a term that encourages every encoded input to be close to at least one prototype, and a term that encourages faithful reconstruction by the autoencoder. The distances computed in the prototype layer are used as part of the classification process. Since the prototypes are learned during training, the learned network naturally comes with explanations for each prediction, and the explanations are loyal to what the network actually computes.","2017-10","2019-09-20 10:15:39","2019-09-20 10:15:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04806v2  bibtex*[comments=Presents a specific method for enhancing explainability for models,]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experiments on a CUB bird classification and explanation dataset show qualitatively and quantitatively that the model is able to generate high-quality explanations.

The interpretation results are displayed visually via diagrams, which clearly indicates how a specific test instance is classified.

To ameliorate this problem, we introduce the use of hierarchical interpretations to explain DNN predictions through our proposed method, agglomerative contextual decomposition (ACD). Given a prediction from a trained DNN, ACD produces a hierarchical clustering of the input features, along with the contribution of each cluster to the final prediction. This hierarchy is optimized to identify clusters of features that the DNN learned are predictive. Using examples from Stanford Sentiment Treebank and ImageNet, we show that ACD is effective at diagnosing incorrect predictions and identifying dataset bias. Through human experiments, we demonstrate that ACD enables users both to identify the more accurate of two DNNs and to better trust a DNN's outputs. We also find that ACD's hierarchy is largely robust to adversarial perturbations, implying that it captures fundamental aspects of the input and ignores spurious noise.","2018-06","2019-09-20 10:15:41","2019-09-20 10:15:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05337v2  bibtex*[comments=Presents a specific method for enhancing explainability for models,]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The neural networks are known to possess good prediction performance, but lack of sufficient model explainability. In this paper, we propose to enhance the explainability of neural networks through the following architecture constraints: a) sparse additive subnetworks; b) orthogonal projection pursuit; and c) smooth function approximation. It leads to a sparse, orthogonal and smooth explainable neural network (SOSxNN). The multiple parameters in the SOSxNN model are simultaneously estimated by a modified mini-batch gradient descent algorithm based on the backpropagation technique for calculating the derivatives and the Cayley transform for preserving the projection orthogonality. The hyperparameters controlling the sparse and smooth constraints are optimized by the grid search. Through simulation studies, we compare the SOSxNN method to several benchmark methods including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, support vector machine, random forest, and multi-layer perceptron. It is shown that proposed model keeps the flexibility of pursuing prediction accuracy while attaining the improved interpretability, which can be therefore used as a promising surrogate model for complex model approximation. Finally, the real data example from the Lending Club is employed as a showcase of the SOSxNN application.","2019-01","2019-09-20 10:15:44","2019-09-20 10:15:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03838v1  bibtex*[comments=Presents a specific method for enhancing explainability for models,]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike previously proposed local methods which try to explain particular classification decisions, we focus on global interpretability and ask a universally applicable question: given a trained model, which features are the most important? In the context of neural networks, a feature is rarely important on its own, so our strategy is specifically designed to leverage partial covariance structures and incorporate variable dependence into feature ranking. Our methodological contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, we propose an effect size analogue for DNNs that is appropriate for applications with highly collinear predictors (ubiquitous in computer vision). Second, we extend the recently proposed ""RelATive cEntrality"" (RATE) measure (Crawford et al., 2019) to the Bayesian deep learning setting.

While local explanation methods exist for one prediction, most global attributions still reduce neural network decisions to a single set of features. In response, we present an approach for generating global attributions called GAM, which explains the landscape of neural network predictions across subpopulations. GAM augments global explanations with the proportion of samples that each attribution best explains and specifies which samples are described by each attribution. Global explanations also have tunable granularity to detect more or fewer subpopulations. We demonstrate that GAM's global explanations 1) yield the known feature importances of simulated data, 2) match feature weights of interpretable statistical models on real data, and 3) are intuitive to practitioners through user studies.

By combining the distilled interpretation knowledge in different layers, we further propose the Refined CHIP visual interpretation that is both high-resolution and class-discriminative.

However, understanding how neural networks produce final predictions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing work on interpreting neural network predictions for images often focuses on explaining predictions for single images or neurons. As predictions are often computed based off of millions of weights that are optimized over millions of images, such explanations can easily miss a bigger picture. We present Summit, the first interactive system that scalably and systematically summarizes and visualizes what features a deep learning model has learned and how those features interact to make predictions. Summit introduces two new scalable summarization techniques: (1) activation aggregation discovers important neurons, and (2) neuron-influence aggregation identifies relationships among such neurons. Summit combines these techniques to create the novel attribution graph that reveals and summarizes crucial neuron associations and substructures that contribute to a model's outcomes. Summit scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images, and leverages neural network feature visualization and dataset examples to help users distill large, complex neural network models into compact, interactive visualizations. We present neural network exploration scenarios where Summit helps us discover multiple surprising insights into a state-of-the-art image classifier's learned representations and informs future neural network architecture design.

In this chapter, we present a method for simultaneously generating accurate and interpretable neural network models for classification using an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm. Lifetime learning is embedded to fine-tune the weights in the evolution that mutates the structure and weights of the neural networks. The efficiency of Baldwin effect and Lamarckian evolution are compared.

For example, safety-related applications for automation and control require that the correctness of the model must be ensured not only for the available data but for all possible input combinations. Thus, understanding what the model has learned and in particular how it will extrapolate to unseen data is a crucial concern. The paper discusses suitable learning methods for classification and regression. For classification problems, we review an approach based on an ensemble of nonlinear low-dimensional submodels, where each submodel is simple enough to be completely verified by domain experts. For regression problems, we review related approaches that try to achieve interpretability by using low-dimensional submodels (for instance, MARS and tree-growing methods). We compare them with symbolic regression, which is a different approach based on genetic algorithms. Finally, a novel approach is proposed for combining a symbolic regression model, which is shown to be easily interpretable, with a Gaussian Process. The combined model has an improved accuracy and provides error bounds in the sense that the deviation from the verified symbolic model is always kept below a defined limit.","2013","2019-09-20 10:15:48","2019-09-20 10:15:48","","111-122","","","","","","Safe and <span class=""nocase"">Interpretable Machine Learning</span>","Studies in <span class=""nocase"">Computational Intelligence</span>","","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","English","","","","","","","Citation Key: otteSafeInterpretableMachine2013  bibtex*[comments=Reviews the current state of explainability research,]","","","","Input Space; Methodological Review; Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline; Symbolic Model; Symbolic Regression","","Moewes, Christian; Nürnberger, Andreas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, they can be trained to predict, and even generate plausible text with few or no spelling and syntax errors. However, it is not clear what grammar a network has learned, or how it keeps track of the syntactic structure of its input. In this paper, we present a new method to extract a finite state machine from a recurrent neural network. A FSM is in principle a more interpretable representation of a grammar than a neural net would be, however the extracted FSMs for realistic neural networks will also be large. Therefore, we also look at ways to group the states and paths through the extracted FSM so as to get a smaller, easier to understand model of the neural network. To illustrate our methods, we use them to investigate how a neural network learns noun-verb agreement from a simple grammar where relative clauses may appear between noun and verb.","2018","2019-09-20 10:15:48","2019-09-20 10:15:48","","284-296","","","","","","","Lecture <span class=""nocase"">Notes</span> in <span class=""nocase"">Computer Science</span>","","","","Springer International Publishing","","English","","","","","","","Citation Key: pomarlanUnderstandingNLPNeural2018  bibtex*[comments=Presents a specific method for enhancing explainability for models,]","","","","Interpretability; Natural language processing; Recurrent neural networks","","Trollmann, Frank; Turhan, Anni-Yasmin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our general hypothesis is twofold: (1) There exists patterns in the relationship between problems and solutions and there should be data or a body of knowledge that describes how problems and solutions relate; and (2) the identification, manipulation, and learning of such patterns through case features can help create and reuse explanations for solutions produced by the target method. When the target method relies on neural network architectures (e.g., deep learning), the resulting latent space (i.e., word embeddings) becomes useful for finding patterns and semantic relatedness in textual data. In the proposed approach, case problems are input-output pairs from the target method, and case solutions are explanations. We exemplify our approach by explaining recommended citations from Citeomatic - a multi-layer neural-network architecture from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Citation analysis is the body of knowledge that describes how query documents (i.e., inputs) relate to recommended citations (i.e., outputs). We build cases and similarity assessment to learn features that represent patterns between problems and solutions that can lead to the reuse of corresponding explanations. The illustrative implementation we present becomes an explanation-augmented citation recommender that targets human-computer trust.","2018","2019-09-20 10:15:49","2019-09-20 10:15:49","","431-447","","","","","","","Lecture <span class=""nocase"">Notes</span> in <span class=""nocase"">Computer Science</span>","","","","Springer International Publishing","","English","","","","","","","Citation Key: weberInvestigatingTextualCaseBased2018  bibtex*[comments=Presents a specific method for enhancing explainability for models,]","","","","Case-Based reasoning; Citation recommendation; Explainable artificial intelligence; Human-Computer trust; Semantic relatedness; Textual Case-Based reasoning; Word embeddings","","Cox, Michael T.; Funk, Peter; Begum, Shahina","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meanwhile, it has been observed that many shallow models, such as linear models or tree-based models, are fairly interpretable though not accurate enough. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we investigate how to fully take advantage of the interpretability of shallow models in neural networks. To this end, we propose a novel interpretable neural model with Interactive Stepwise Influence (ISI) framework. Specifically, in each iteration of the learning process, ISI interactively trains a shallow model with soft labels computed from a neural network, and the learned shallow model is then used to influence the neural network to gain interpretability. Thus ISI could achieve interpretability in three aspects: importance of features, impact of feature value changes, and adaptability of feature weights in the neural network learning process. Experiments on both synthetic and two real-world datasets demonstrate that ISI could generate reliable interpretation with respect to the three aspects, as well as preserve prediction accuracy by comparing with other state-of-the-art methods.","2019","2019-09-20 10:15:50","2019-09-20 10:15:50","","528-540","","","","","","","Lecture <span class=""nocase"">Notes</span> in <span class=""nocase"">Computer Science</span>","","","","Springer International Publishing","","English","","","","","","","Citation Key: zhangInterpretableNeuralModel2019  bibtex*[comments=Presents a specific method for enhancing explainability for models,]","","","","Interpretation; Neural network; Stepwise Influence","","Yang, Qiang; Zhou, Zhi-Hua; Gong, Zhiguo; Zhang, Min-Ling; Huang, Sheng-Jun","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although deep neural networks have exhibited superior performance in various tasks, interpretability is always Achilles' heel of deep neural networks. At present, deep neural networks obtain high discrimination power at the cost of a low interpretability of their black-box representations. We believe that high model interpretability may help people break several bottlenecks of deep learning, e.g., learning from a few annotations, learning via human–computer communications at the semantic level, and semantically debugging network representations. We focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and revisit the visualization of CNN representations, methods of diagnosing representations of pre-trained CNNs, approaches for disentangling pre-trained CNN representations, learning of CNNs with disentangled representations, and middle-to-end learning based on model interpretability. Finally, we discuss prospective trends in explainable artificial intelligence.","2018-01","2019-09-20 10:15:50","2019-09-20 10:15:50","","27-39","","1","19","","","Visual interpretability for deep learning","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Citation Key: zhangVisualInterpretabilityDeep2018  bibtex*[comments=Reviews the current state of explainability research,]","","","","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Interpretable model; TP391","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
