  abstract = {Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become popular in the last few years. The artificial intelligence (AI) community in general, and the machine learning (ML) community in particular, is coming to the realisation that in many applications, for AI to be trusted, it must not only demonstrate good performance in its decisionmaking, but it also must explain these decisions and convince us that it is making the decisions for the right reasons. However, different applications have different requirements on the information required of the underlying AI system in order to convince us that it is worthy of our trust. How do we define these requirements? In this paper, we present three dimensions for categorising the explanatory requirements of different applications. These are Source, Depth and Scope. We focus on the problem of matching up the explanatory requirements of different applications with the capabilities of underlying ML techniques to provide them. We deliberately avoid including aspects of explanation that are already well-covered by the existing literature and we focus our discussion on ML although the principles apply to AI more broadly.},

It is worthy to remark that we found out that about one third of contributions in XAI come from the fuzzy logic community. Accordingly, we went in depth with the actual connections of fuzzy logic contributions with AI to promote and improve XAI systems in the broad sense. Finally, we outlined new research directions aimed at strengthening the integration of different fields of AI, including fuzzy logic, toward the common objective of making AI accessible to people.},

Different kinds of users are identified and their concerns revealed, relevant statements from the General Data Protection Regulation are analyzed in the context of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a taxonomy for the classification of existing explanation methods is introduced, and finally, the various classes of explanation methods are analyzed to verify if user concerns are justified. Overall, it is clear that (visual) explanations can be given about various aspects of the influence of the input on the output. However, it is noted that explanation methods or interfaces for lay users are missing and we speculate which criteria these methods/interfaces should satisfy. Finally it is noted that two important concerns are difficult to address with explanation methods: the concern about bias in datasets that leads to biased DNNs, as well as the suspicion about unfair outcomes.},

We believe that high model interpretability may help people break several bottlenecks of deep learning, e.g., learning from a few annotations, learning via human\textendash{}computer communications at the semantic level, and semantically debugging network representations. We focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and revisit the visualization of CNN representations, methods of diagnosing representations of pre-trained CNNs, approaches for disentangling pre-trained CNN representations, learning of CNNs with disentangled representations, and middle-to-end learning based on model interpretability.

This chapter discusses the role of explanation mechanisms in building fair machine learning models and explainable ML technique. We focus on the special case of recommender systems because they are a prominent example of a ML model that interacts directly with humans. This is in contrast to many other traditional decision making systems that interact with experts (e.g. in the health-care domain). In addition, we discuss the main sources of bias that can lead to biased and unfair models. We then review the taxonomy of explanation styles for recommender systems and review models that can provide explanations for their recommendations. We conclude by reviewing evaluation metrics for assessing the power of explainability in recommender systems.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has been successfully applied to a wide variety of fields ranging from information retrieval, data mining, and speech recognition, to computer graphics, visualization, and human-computer interaction. However, most users often treat a machine learning model as a black box because of its incomprehensible functions and unclear working mechanism (Liu et al. 2017). Without a clear understanding of how and why a model works, the development of high performance models for chatbots typically relies on a time-consuming trial-and-error process. As a result, academic and industrial ML chatbot developers are facing challenges that demand more transparent and explainable systems for better understanding and analyzing ML models, especially their inner working mechanisms.In this Chapter we focus on explainability. We first discuss what is explainable ML and how its features are desired by users. We then draw an example chatbot-related classification problem and show how it is solved by a transparent rule-based or ML method. After that we present a decision support-enabled chatbot that shares its explanations to back up its decisions and tackles that of a human peer. We conclude this chapter with a learning framework representing a deterministic inductive approach with complete explainability.},

Existing models designed to produce interpretable traces of their decision-making process typically require these traces to be supervised at training time. In this paper, we present a novel neural modular approach that performs compositional reasoning by automatically inducing a desired sub-task decomposition without relying on strong supervision. Our model allows linking different reasoning tasks though shared modules that handle common routines across tasks. Experiments show that the model is more interpretable to human evaluators compared to other state-of-the-art models: users can better understand the model's underlying reasoning procedure and predict when it will succeed or fail based on observing its intermediate outputs.},

  issn = {1433-3058},
  abstract = {In a short period of time, many areas of science have made a sharp transition towards data-dependent methods. In some cases, this process has been enabled by simultaneous advances in data acquisition and the development of networked system technologies. This new situation is particularly clear in the life sciences, where data overabundance has sparked a flurry of new methodologies for data management and analysis. This can be seen as a perfect scenario for the use of machine learning and computational intelligence techniques to address problems in which more traditional data analysis approaches might struggle. But, this scenario also poses some serious challenges. One of them is model interpretability and explainability, especially for complex nonlinear models. In some areas such as medicine and health care, not addressing such challenge might seriously limit the chances of adoption, in real practice, of computer-based systems that rely on machine learning and computational intelligence methods for data analysis. In this paper, we reflect on recent investigations about the interpretability and explainability of machine learning methods and discuss their impact on medicine and health care. We pay specific attention to one of the ways in which interpretability and explainability in this context can be addressed, which is through data and model visualization. We argue that, beyond improving model interpretability as a goal in itself, we need to integrate the medical experts in the design of data analysis interpretation strategies. Otherwise, machine learning is unlikely to become a part of routine clinical and health care practice.},

Expressing the rationale behind such a system's output is an important aspect of human-machine interaction as AI continues to be prominent in general, everyday use-cases. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework integrating Grenander's pattern theory structures to produce inherently explainable, symbolic representations for activity interpretations. These representations provide semantically rich and coherent interpretations of video activity using connected structures of detected (grounded) concepts, such as objects and actions, that are bound by semantics through background concepts not directly observed, i.e. contextualization cues. We use contextualization cues to establish semantic relationships among concepts to infer a deeper interpretation of events than what can be directly sensed. We propose the use of six questions that can be used to gain insight into the models ability to justify its decision and enhance its ability to interact with humans. The six questions are designed to (1) build an understanding of how the model is able to infer interpretations, (2) enable us to walk through its decision-making process, and (3) understand its drawbacks and possibly address them. We demonstrate the viability of this idea on video data using a dialog model that uses interpretations to generate explanations grounded in both video data and semantics.},

However, experience from many ML applications in difficult, domains indicates the importance of interpretability of induced descriptions. Often in such domains, predictive accuracy is hardly of interest to the user. Instead, the users' interest now lies in the interpretion of the induced descriptions and not, in their use for prediction. In such cases, ML is essentially used as a tool for exploring the domain, to generate new, potentially useful ideas about the domain, and thus improve the user's understanding of the domain. The important questions are how to make domain-specific background knowledge usable by the learning system, and how to interpret the results in the light of this background expertise. These questions are discussed and illustrated by relevant example applications of ML, including: medical diagnosis, ecological modelling, and interpreting discrete event simulations. The observations in these applications show that predictive accuracy, the usual measure of success in ML, should be accompanied by a. criterion of interpretability of induced descriptions. The formalisation of interpretability is however a completely new challenge for ML.},

For example, safety-related applications for automation and control require that the correctness of the model must be ensured not only for the available data but for all possible input combinations. Thus, understanding what the model has learned and in particular how it will extrapolate to unseen data is a crucial concern. The paper discusses suitable learning methods for classification and regression. For classification problems, we review an approach based on an ensemble of nonlinear low-dimensional submodels, where each submodel is simple enough to be completely verified by domain experts. For regression problems, we review related approaches that try to achieve interpretability by using low-dimensional submodels (for instance, MARS and tree-growing methods). We compare them with symbolic regression, which is a different approach based on genetic algorithms. Finally, a novel approach is proposed for combining a symbolic regression model, which is shown to be easily interpretable, with a Gaussian Process. The combined model has an improved accuracy and provides error bounds in the sense that the deviation from the verified symbolic model is always kept below a defined limit.},

Inspired by the neuroanatomy of the brain during creative cognition, the proposed framework's hybrid architecture blends both symbolic and connectionist AI, inline with Minsky's ``society of mind''. At its core, semantic gates are designed to facilitate an input/output flow of semantic structures and enable the usage of aligning mechanisms between neural activation clusters and semantic graphs. Having as goal alignment maximization, such a system would enable interpretability through the creation of labeled patterns of computation, and propose unaligned but relevant computation patterns as novel and useful, therefore creative.},

While transparency and explainability are certainly important desiderata in algorithmic governance, we worry that automated decision-making is being held to an unrealistically high standard, possibly owing to an unrealistically high estimate of the degree of transparency attainable from human decision-makers. In this paper, we review evidence demonstrating that much human decision-making is fraught with transparency problems, show in what respects AI fares little worse or better and argue that at least some regulatory proposals for explainable AI could end up setting the bar higher than is necessary or indeed helpful. The demands of practical reason require the justification of action to be pitched at the level of practical reason. Decision tools that support or supplant practical reasoning should not be expected to aim higher than this. We cast this desideratum in terms of Daniel Dennett's theory of the ``intentional stance'' and argue that since the justification of action for human purposes takes the form of intentional stance explanation, the justification of algorithmic decisions should take the same form. In practice, this means that the sorts of explanations for algorithmic decisions that are analogous to intentional stance explanations should be preferred over ones that aim at the architectural innards of a decision tool.},

Due to the huge ongoing success in machine learning, particularly in statistical learning from big data, there is rising interest of academia, industry and the public in this field. Industry is investing heavily in AI, and spin-offs and start-ups are emerging on an unprecedented rate. The European Union is allocating a lot of additional funding into AI research grants, and various institutions are calling for a joint European AI research institute. Even universities are taking AI/ML into their curricula and strategic plans. Finally, even the people on the street talk about it, and if grandma knows what her grandson is doing in his new start-up, then the time is ripe: We are reaching a new AI spring. However, as fantastic current approaches seem to be, there are still huge problems to be solved: the best performing models lack transparency, hence are considered to be black boxes. The general and worldwide trends in privacy, data protection, safety and security make such black box solutions difficult to use in practice. Specifically in Europe, where the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect on May, 28, 2018 which affects everybody (right of explanation). Consequently, a previous niche field for many years, explainable AI, explodes in importance. For the future, we envision a fruitful marriage between classic logical approaches (ontologies) with statistical approaches which may lead to context-adaptive systems (stochastic ontologies) that might work similar as the human brain.},

  abstract = {Explainable AI is not a new field. Since at least the early exploitation of C.S. Pierce's abductive reasoning in expert systems of the 1980s, there were reasoning architectures to support an explanation function for complex AI systems, including applications in medical diagnosis, complex multi-component design, and reasoning about the real world. So explainability is at least as old as early AI, and a natural consequence of the design of AI systems. While early expert systems consisted of handcrafted knowledge bases that enabled reasoning over narrowly well-defined domains (e.g., INTERNIST, MYCIN), such systems had no learning capabilities and had only primitive uncertainty handling. But the evolution of formal reasoning architectures to incorporate principled probabilistic reasoning helped address the capture and use of uncertain knowledge.There has been recent and relatively rapid success of AI/machine learning solutions arises from neural network architectures. A new generation of neural methods now scale to exploit the practical applicability of statistical and algebraic learning approaches in arbitrarily high dimensional spaces. But despite their huge successes, largely in problems which can be cast as classification problems, their effectiveness is still limited by their un-debuggability, and their inability to ``explain'' their decisions in a human understandable and reconstructable way. So while AlphaGo or DeepStack can crush the best humans at Go or Poker, neither program has any internal model of its task; its representations defy interpretation by humans, there is no mechanism to explain their actions and behaviour, and furthermore, there is no obvious instructional value ... the high performance systems can not help humans improve.Even when we understand the underlying mathematical scaffolding of current machine learning architectures, it is often impossible to get insight into the internal working of the models; we need explicit modeling and reasoning tools to explain how and why a result was achieved. We also know that a significant challenge for future AI is contextual adaptation, i.e., systems that incrementally help to construct explanatory models for solving real-world problems. Here it would be beneficial not to exclude human expertise, but to augment human intelligence with artificial intelligence.},

In this chapter, we present a method for simultaneously generating accurate and interpretable neural network models for classification using an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm. Lifetime learning is embedded to fine-tune the weights in the evolution that mutates the structure and weights of the neural networks. The efficiency of Baldwin effect and Lamarckian evolution are compared. It is found that the Lamarckian evolution outperforms the Baldwin effect in evolutionary multi-objective optimization of neural networks. Simulation results on two benchmark problems demonstrate that the evolutionary multi-objective approach is able to generate both accurate and understandable neural network models, which can be used for different purpose.},

In this work, we consider simultaneously the important issues of model performance, earliness, and interpretability to propose a deep-learning framework based on the attention mechanism for multivariate time-series early classification. In the proposed model, we used a deep-learning method to extract the features among multiple variables and capture the temporal relation that exists in multivariate time-series data. Additionally, the proposed method uses the attention mechanism to identify the critical segments related to model performance, providing a base to facilitate the better understanding of the model for further decision making. We conducted experiments on three real datasets and compared with several alternatives. While the proposed method can achieve comparable performance results and earliness compared to other alternatives, more importantly, it can provide interpretability by highlighting the important parts of the original data, rendering it easier for users to understand how the prediction is induced from the data.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks have achieved promising prediction performance, but are often criticized for the lack of interpretability, which is essential in many real-world applications such as health informatics and political science. Meanwhile, it has been observed that many shallow models, such as linear models or tree-based models, are fairly interpretable though not accurate enough. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we investigate how to fully take advantage of the interpretability of shallow models in neural networks. To this end, we propose a novel interpretable neural model with Interactive Stepwise Influence (ISI) framework. Specifically, in each iteration of the learning process, ISI interactively trains a shallow model with soft labels computed from a neural network, and the learned shallow model is then used to influence the neural network to gain interpretability. Thus ISI could achieve interpretability in three aspects: importance of features, impact of feature value changes, and adaptability of feature weights in the neural network learning process. Experiments on both synthetic and two real-world datasets demonstrate that ISI could generate reliable interpretation with respect to the three aspects, as well as preserve prediction accuracy by comparing with other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Deep neural perception and control networks are likely to be a key component of self-driving vehicles. These models need to be explainable\textemdash{}they should provide easy-to-interpret rationales for their behavior\textemdash{}so that passengers, insurance companies, law enforcement, developers etc., can understand what triggered a particular behavior. Here, we explore the use of visual explanations. These explanations take the form of real-time highlighted regions of an image that causally influence the network's output (steering control). Our approach is two-stage. In the first stage, we use a visual attention model to train a convolutional network end-to-end from images to steering angle. The attention model highlights image regions that potentially influence the network's output. Some of these are true influences, but some are spurious. We then apply a causal filtering step to determine which input regions actually influence the output. This produces more succinct visual explanations and more accurately exposes the network's behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on three datasets totaling 16 h of driving. We first show that training with attention does not degrade the performance of the end-to-end network. Then we show that the network highlights interpretable features that are used by humans while driving, and causal filtering achieves a useful reduction in explanation complexity by removing features which do not significantly affect the output.},

  abstract = {This is a chapter about what link analysis and data mining can do for criminal investigation. It is a long and complex chapter, in which a variety of techniques and topics are accommodated. It is divided in two parts, one about methods, and the other one about real-case studies. We begin by discussing social networks and their visualisation, as well as what unites them with or distinguishes them from link analysis (which itself historically arose from the disciplinary context of ergonomics). Having considered applications of link analysis to criminal investigation, we turn to crime risk assessment, to geographic information systems for mapping crimes, to detection, and then to multiagent architectures and their application to policing. We then turn to the challenge of handling a disparate mass of data, and introduce the reader to data warehousing, XML, ontologies, legal ontologies, and financial fraud ontology. A section about automated summarisation and its application to law is followed by a discussion of text mining and its application to law, and by a section on support vector machines for information retrieval, text classification, and matching. A section follows, about stylometrics, determining authorship, handwriting identification and its automation, and questioned documents evidence. We next discuss classification, clustering, series analysis, and association in knowledge discovery from legal databases; then, inconsistent data; rule induction (including in law); using neural networks in the legal context; fuzzy logic; and genetic algorithms. Before turning to case studies of link analysis and data mining, we take a broad view of digital resources and uncovering perpetration: email mining, computer forensics, and intrusion detection. We consider the Enron email database; the discovery of social coalitions with the SIGHTS text mining system, and recursive data mining. We discuss digital forensics, digital steganography, and intrusion detection (the use of learning techniques, the detection of masquerading, and honeypots for trapping intruders). Case studies include, for example: investigating Internet auction fraud with NetProbe; graph mining for malware detection with Polonium; link analysis with Coplink; a project of the U.S. Federal Defense Financial Accounting Service; information extraction tools for integration with a link analysis tool; the Poznan ontology model for the link analysis of fuel fraud; and fiscal fraud detection with the Pisa SNIPER project.},

In modern cities, everything (at work, at home, and even in the streets) is connected to Internet. Accordingly, the amount of data in Internet grows dramatically every day. With this regard, humans face two main challenges: (1) to extract valuable knowledge from the given Big Data and (2) to become part of the equation, i.e., to become active actors in the Internet of Things. To do so, researchers and developers have created a novel generation of intelligent systems which are producing more and more intelligent devices, yielding what is called smart cities. Fuzzy systems are used in many applications in the context of Smart Cities. Now, it is time to address the effective interaction between intelligent systems and citizens with the aim of passing from smart to Cognitive Cities. Moreover, the use of interpretable fuzzy systems can facilitate such interaction and pave the way towards Cognitive Cities.},

  isbn = {978-3-319-30319-2},
  abstract = {Sentiment analysis, which is also known as opinion mining, has been an increasingly popular research area focusing on sentiment classification/regression. In many studies, computational models have been considered as effective and efficient tools for sentiment analysis . Computational models could be built by using expert knowledge or learning from data. From this viewpoint, the design of computational models could be categorized into expert based design and data based design. Due to the vast and rapid increase in data, the latter approach of design has become increasingly more popular for building computational models. A data based design typically follows machine learning approaches, each of which involves a particular strategy of learning. Therefore, the resulting computational models are usually represented in different forms. For example, neural network learning results in models in the form of multi-layer perceptron network whereas decision tree learning results in a rule set in the form of decision tree. On the basis of above description, interpretability has become a main problem that arises with computational models. This chapter explores the significance of interpretability for computational models as well as analyzes the factors that impact on interpretability. This chapter also introduces several ways to evaluate and improve the interpretability for computational models which are used as sentiment analysis systems. In particular, rule based systems , a special type of computational models, are used as an example for illustration with respects to evaluation and improvements through the use of computational intelligence methodologies.},

This represents a substantial increase in reports over 2017, where just one abstract each was reported at ASRM (AI) and ESHRE (ML). Our analysis reveals wide variability in how AI and ML methods are described (from not at all or very generic to fully describing the architectural framework) and large variability on accepted dataset sizes (from just 3 patients with 16 follicles in the smallest dataset to 661,060 images of 11,898 human embryos in one of the largest).

The key pillars underlying the deep learning revolution for NLP consist of (1) distributed representations of linguistic entities via embedding, (2) semantic generalization due to the embedding, (3) long-span deep sequence modeling of natural language, (4) hierarchical networks effective for representing linguistic levels from low to high, and (5) end-to-end deep learning methods to jointly solve many NLP tasks.

The present contribution addresses the resulting lack of conceptual tools for an epistemological discussion of machine learning by conceiving of deep learning networks as `judging machines' and using the Kantian analysis of judgments for specifying the type of judgment they are capable of. At the center of the argument is the fact that the functionality of deep learning networks is established by training and cannot be explained and justified by reference to a predefined rule-based procedure. Instead, the computational process of a deep learning network is barely explainable and needs further justification, as is shown in reference to the current research literature. Thus, it requires a new form of justification, that is to be specified with the help of Kant's epistemology.},

Owing to the development of machine learning theory and the accumulation of pharmacological data, the artificial intelligence (AI) technology, as a powerful data mining tool, has cut a figure in various fields of the drug design, such as virtual screening, activity scoring, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis, de novo drug design, and in silico evaluation of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADME/T) properties. Although it is still challenging to provide a physical explanation of the AI-based models, it indeed has been acting as a great power to help manipulating the drug discovery through the versatile frameworks. Recently, due to the strong generalization ability and powerful feature extraction capability, deep learning methods have been employed in predicting the molecular properties as well as generating the desired molecules, which will further promote the application of AI technologies in the field of drug design.},

The second, representation-centric perspective distills insight from holistically analyzed book chapters from cognitive science viewpoints and in terms of two basic types of natural language representations: symbolic and distributed representations. In the second part of the epilogue, we update the most recent progress on deep learning in NLP (mainly during the later part of 2017, not surveyed in earlier chapters). Based on our reviews of these rapid recent advances, we then enrich our earlier writing on the research frontiers of NLP in Chap. 1 by addressing future directions of exploiting compositionality of natural language for generalization, unsupervised and reinforcement learning for NLP and their intricate connections, meta-learning for NLP, and weak-sense and strong-sense interpretability for NLP systems based on deep learning.},

But as the complexity of a typical FRBS increases, it often becomes more like an uninterpretable neural network, and the Principle of Incompatibility predicts a degradation in interpretability for the same accuracy. This is particularly true of the so-called Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK), or simply the Sugeno, approximator. We argue that imposing additional structure on the TSK system can significantly improve the tradeoff inherent in the Principle of Incompatibility. A promising structure was proposed recently in which the membership functions are local and sufficiently differentiable, and the consequent polynomials are rule-centered. This structure leads to the general interpretation that the consequent polynomials are Taylor series expansions. On this interpretation, a foundation for an algebra and a calculus of FRBSs can be built. We will illustrate these aspects of the proposed structure and discuss issues of modularity, functionality, and scalability of FRBSs.},

Perhaps the recent advances that are driving other technical fields are not sufficiently distinguished from long-known informatics methods for materials, thereby masking their likely impact to the materials, processes, and structures engineering (MPSE). Alternatively, the diverse nature and limited availability of relevant materials data pose obstacles to machine-learning implementation. The glimpse captured in this overview is intended to draw focus to selected distinguishing advances, and to show that there are opportunities for these new technologies to have transformational impacts on MPSE. Further, there are opportunities for the MPSE fields to contribute understanding to the emerging machine-learning tools from a physics basis. We suggest that there is an immediate need to expand the use of these new tools throughout MPSE, and to begin the transformation of engineering education that is necessary for ongoing adoption of the methods.},

  abstract = {Deep learning techniques are rapidly advanced recently and becoming a necessity component for widespread systems. However, the inference process of deep learning is black box and is not very suitable to safety-critical systems which must exhibit high transparency. In this paper, to address this black-box limitation, we develop a simple analysis method which consists of (1) structural feature analysis: lists of the features contributing to inference process, (2) linguistic feature analysis: lists of the natural language labels describing the visual attributes for each feature contributing to inference process, and (3) consistency analysis: measuring consistency among input data, inference (label), and the result of our structural and linguistic feature analysis. Our analysis is simplified to reflect the actual inference process for high transparency, whereas it does not include any additional black-box mechanisms such as LSTM for highly human readable results. We conduct experiments and discuss the results of our analysis qualitatively and quantitatively and come to believe that our work improves the transparency of neural networks. Evaluated through 12,800 human tasks, 75\% workers answer that input data and result of our feature analysis are consistent, and 70\% workers answer that inference (label) and result of our feature analysis are consistent. In addition to the evaluation of the proposed analysis, we find that our analysis also provides suggestions, or possible next actions such as expanding neural network complexity or collecting training data to improve a neural network.},

A practical example from visual inspection of production items underlines higher human labeling consistency. The second direction acts on a global level by addressing several criteria which are necessary for a good interpretability of the whole model. By meeting the criteria, the likelihood increases (1) of gaining more funded insights into the behavior of the system, and (2) of stimulating advanced expert/operators feedback in form of active manipulations of the model structure. Possibilities how to best integrate different types of advanced feedback in combination with (on-line) data using incremental model updates will be discussed.

Ideally, by revealing patterns and regularities contained in the data, a rule-based theory yields new insights in the application domain. Recently, several authors have started to investigate how rule-based models can be used for modeling multi-label data. Discussing this task in detail, we highlight some of the problems that make rule learning considerably more challenging for MLC than for conventional classification.

Advances in machine learning (such as deep learning) are on the cusp of providing more effective, more efficient, and even more patient-centric breast cancer screening support than ever before. By leveraging the consistent high sensitivity and specificity performance of autonomous systems, in combination with expert human oversight, the potential for efficient single-reader software-supported screening programs with low recall rates is on the horizon.},

Symbols are objects that are manipulated on the basis of rules operating only on theirshapes, which are arbitrary in relation to what they can be interpreted as meaning. Even if one accepts the Church/Turing Thesis that computation is unique, universal and very near omnipotent, not everything is a computer, because not everything can be given a systematic interpretation; and certainly everything can't be givenevery systematic interpretation. But even after computers and computation have been successfully distinguished from other kinds of things, mental states will not just be the implementations of the right symbol systems, because of the symbol grounding problem: The interpretation of a symbol system is not intrinsic to the system; it is projected onto it by the interpreter. This is not true of our thoughts. We must accordingly be more than just computers. My guess is that the meanings of our symbols are grounded in the substrate of our robotic capacity to interact with that real world of objects, events and states of affairs that our symbols are systematically interpretable as being about.},

Experimental results on two datasets illustrate the relevance of the proposed approach that can be used to gain knowledge about the classifier.},

We propose a generalization of the conventional TS system (GTS) allowing to evaluate the importance of any rule in the inference process. The added value of this feature has been put in light on two well-known chaotic time series.Local (clustering-based) and global (gradient-based) learning strategies for GTS systems are compared in terms of interpretability and accuracy. It appears that there is an unavoidable compromise between these two objectives. Global learning seems to be superior in term of accuracy but cannot achieve the same level of interpretability as the local approach.We also present an application of the GTS model in the field of forecasts combination with the target of generating interpretable final rules. This has led us to put additional constraints in the model. More precisely, we force the local linear models (rules conclusions) to achieve convex combination of the forecasts (input patterns). The proposed system may be useful for a wide range of applications where a consensus is required, including forecasts synthesis, controllers and patterns classifiers aggregation.},

We assume that a set of linguistic terms has been given for each variable. Thus our modelling task is to find a small number of fuzzy rules from possible combinations of the given linguistic terms. First we formulate a three-objective optimization problem, which simultaneously minimizes the total squared error, the number of fuzzy rules, and the total rule length. Next we show how fuzzy GBML algorithms can be applied to our problem in the framework of multi-objective optimization as well as single-objective optimization. Then we point out a possibility that misleading fuzzy rules can be generated when general and specific fuzzy rules are simultaneously used in a single linguistic model. Finally we show that non-standard inclusion-based fuzzy reasoning removes such an undesirable possibility.},

  isbn = {978-3-540-77226-2},
  abstract = {A new approach is proposed for the data-based identification of transparent fuzzy rule-based classifiers. It is observed that fuzzy rule-based classifiers work in a similar manner as kernel function-based support vector machines (SVMs) since both model the input space by nonlinearly maps into a feature space where the decision can be easily made. Accordingly, trained SVM can be used for the construction of fuzzy rule-based classifiers. However, the transformed SVM does not automatically result in an interpretable fuzzy model because the SVM results in a complex rule-base, where the number of rules is approximately 40-60\% of the number of the training data. Hence, reduction of the SVM-initialized classifier is an essential task. For this purpose, a three-step reduction algorithm is developed based on the combination of previously published model reduction techniques. In the first step, the identification of the SVM is followed by the application of the Reduced Set method to decrease the number of kernel functions. The reduced SVM is then transformed into a fuzzy rule-based classifier. The interpretability of a fuzzy model highly depends on the distribution of the membership functions. Hence, the second reduction step is achieved by merging similar fuzzy sets based on a similarity measure. Finally, in the third step, an orthogonal least-squares method is used to reduce the number of rules and re-estimate the consequent parameters of the fuzzy rule-based classifier. The proposed approach is applied for the Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Iris and Wine classification problems to compare its performance to other methods.},

These two actors, however, traditionally use different paradigms for representing and manipulating information. Users are more inclined in managing perceptual information, usually expressed in natural language, whilst computers are formidable number-crunching systems, capable of manipulating information expressed in precise form. Fuzzy information granules could be used as a common interface for communicating information and knowledge, because of their ability of representing perceptual information in a computer manageable form. Nonetheless, this connection could be established only if information granules are interpretable, i.e. they are semantically co-intensive with human knowledge. Interpretable information granulation opens several methodological issues, regarding the representation and manipulation of information granules, the interpretability constraints and the granulation processes. By taking into account all such issues, effective Information Processing systems could be designed with a strong Human-Centric imprint.},

Based on our analysis of cyber threats and opportunities in the coming years, we assess it as very likely that teams consisting of humans and synthetic agents will routinely work together in many if not most organizations. To fully leverage the potential of these teams, we must continue to develop new paradigms in human-machine teaming. Specifically, we must address three areas that are currently in their infancy. Firstly, we need interfaces that allow all teammates to communicate effectively with each other and seamlessly transfer tasks among them. This must be true regardless of whether the endpoints are human or not. Secondly, we will need cybersecurity operators with broad knowledge and skills. They must know how their synthetic teammates ``think,'' when to task them and when to question their reports. Thirdly, our AI systems must be able to explain their decision-making processes to their human teammates. This paper provides an overview of cyberspace threats and opportunities in the next ten years and how these will impact human-machine teaming. We then apply the key lessons we have learned while working a multitude of advanced research projects at the intersection of human and AI agents to cyberspace operations.

  abstract = {Anticipation occupies a special role in Artificial Intelligence (AI), not only because replicating human anticipatory processes is naturally a part of the aim to replicate human intelligence, but also because the design, implementation, and evaluation of AI systems involves a mix of several, interdependent anticipatory processes, some of which are carried out by human designers and users, and others by the AI system. This chapter provides an introduction to key AI technologies, investigates to what extent they involve anticipatory processes, and explores the consequences of such anticipation on the predictability of AI systems for humans. Our analysis suggests that the relationship between human and AI anticipation is complementary - the more pronounced the anticipatory capabilities of the AI system, the harder it may be for humans to anticipate their behaviour. If this turns out to be correct, building safe, responsible, and ethically sound AI will require developing more understandable and explainable AI methods in the future.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models make decisions for governments, companies, and individuals. Accordingly, there is the increasing concern of not having a rich explanatory and predictive account of the behaviour of these ML models relative to the users' interests (goals) and (pre-)conceptions (ontologies). We argue that the recent research trends in finding better characterisations of what a ML model does are leading to the view of ML models as complex behavioural systems. A good explanation for a model should depend on how well it describes the behaviour of the model in simpler, more comprehensible, or more understandable terms according to a given context. Consequently, we claim that a more contextual abstraction is necessary (as is done in system theory and psychology), which is very much like building a subjective mind modelling problem. We bring some research evidence of how this partial and subjective modelling of machine learning models can take place, suggesting that more machine learning is the answer.},

  isbn = {978-3-642-13639-9},
  abstract = {Fuzzy neural network (FNN), a hybrid of fuzzy logic and neural network, is computationally powerful, robust and able to model a complex nonlinear problem domain via the extraction and self-tuning of fuzzy IF-THEN rules. This yields a powerful semantic learning memory system that is useful to build intelligent decision support tools. Thermal imaging has been effectively used in the detection of infrared spectrum for the screening of potential SARS patients. This chapter proposes a cognitive approach in the study of the correlation and semantic interpretation of superficial thermal images against the true internal body temperature. Comparison between global and local semantic memories as well as Mamdani and TSK model of FNNs are presented. Existing infrared systems are commonly used at various boarder checkpoints and these have high false-negative rate. The use of FNN as a back-end of the system can significantly improves and hence serves the role of an intelligent medical decision support tool with high degree of accuracy. Extensive experimentations are conducted on real-life data taken from the Emergency Department (A\&E), Tan Tock Seng Hospital (the designated SARS center in Singapore). The performance of FNN as the thermal analysis decision support system, providing plausible semantic interpretation and understanding, is highly encouraging.},

  abstract = {Artificial Neural Networks (ANNS) are used successfully in industry and commerce. This is not surprising since neural networks are especially competitive for complex tasks for which insufficient domain-specific knowledge is available. However, interpretation of models induced by ANNS is often extremely difficult. BP-SOM is an relatively novel neural network architecture and learning algorithm which offers possibilities to overcome this limitation. BP-SOM is a combination of a multi-layered feed-forward network (MFN) trained with the back-propagation learning rule (BP), and Kohonen's self-organizing maps (sorts). In earlier reports, it has been shown that BP-SOM improved the generalization performance as compared to that of BP, while at the same time it decreased the number of necessary hidden units without loss of generalization performance. In this paper we demonstrate that BP-SOM trained networks results in uniform and clustered hidden layer representations appropriate for interpretation of the networks functionality.},

  abstract = {The notion of computation has changed the world more than any previous expressions of knowledge. However, as know-how in its particular algorithmic embodiment, computation is closed to meaning. Therefore, computer-based data processing can only mimic life's creative aspects, without being creative itself. AI's current record of accomplishments shows that it automates tasks associated with intelligence, without being intelligent itself. Mistaking the abstract (computation) for the concrete (computer) has led to the religion of ``everything is an output of computation''\textemdash{}even the humankind that conceived the computer. The hypostatized role of computers explains the increased dependence on them. The convergence machine called deep learning is only the most recent form through which the deterministic theology of the machine claims more than what it actually is: extremely effective data processing. A proper understanding of complexity, as well as the need to distinguish between the reactive nature of the artificial and the anticipatory nature of the living are suggested as practical responses to the challenges posed by machine theology.},

  shorttitle = {Ultra-{{Strong Machine Learning}}},
  abstract = {During the 1980s Michie defined Machine Learning in terms of two orthogonal axes of performance: predictive accuracy and comprehensibility of generated hypotheses. Since predictive accuracy was readily measurable and comprehensibility not so, later definitions in the 1990s, such as Mitchell's, tended to use a one-dimensional approach to Machine Learning based solely on predictive accuracy, ultimately favouring statistical over symbolic Machine Learning approaches. In this paper we provide a definition of comprehensibility of hypotheses which can be estimated using human participant trials. We present two sets of experiments testing human comprehensibility of logic programs. In the first experiment we test human comprehensibility with and without predicate invention. Results indicate comprehensibility is affected not only by the complexity of the presented program but also by the existence of anonymous predicate symbols. In the second experiment we directly test whether any state-of-the-art ILP systems are ultra-strong learners in Michie's sense, and select the Metagol system for use in humans trials. Results show participants were not able to learn the relational concept on their own from a set of examples but they were able to apply the relational definition provided by the ILP system correctly. This implies the existence of a class of relational concepts which are hard to acquire for humans, though easy to understand given an abstract explanation. We believe improved understanding of this class could have potential relevance to contexts involving human learning, teaching and verbal interaction.},
