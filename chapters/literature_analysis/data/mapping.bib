  title = {A Study on Interpretability of Decision of Machine Learning},
  abstract = {Machine learning is one of the most important fields in recent improvement in big data analysis. Many people apply machine learning for a variety of domains for various purposes, such as classification of opinions. However, the constructed models of machine learning are black boxes. They cannot understand the background reason for their decisions. In many cases, understanding the reasons important. In this paper, we focus on interpretation of models and understanding of decision reasons. First, we introduce the results of an opinions classification of the reviews with Support Vector Machine (SVM). Second, we interpret the model by analyzing weights of the model. Third, we introduce a method for helping to understand the reasons for a decision by SVM by providing a simplified information of the highly weighted words.},

  title = {An {{Adversarial Approach}} for {{Explainable AI}} in {{Intrusion Detection Systems}}},
  abstract = {Despite the growing popularity of modern machine learning techniques (e.g, Deep Neural Networks) in cyber-security applications, most of these models are perceived as a black-box for the user. Adversarial machine learning offers an approach to increase our understanding of these models. In this paper we present an approach to generate explanations for incorrect classifications made by data-driven Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) An adversarial approach is used to find the minimum modifications (of the input features) required to correctly classify a given set of misclassified samples. The magnitude of such modifications is used to visualize the most relevant features that explain the reason for the misclassification. The presented methodology generated satisfactory explanations that describe the reasoning behind the mis-classifications, with descriptions that match expert knowledge. The advantages of the presented methodology are: 1) applicable to any classifier with defined gradients. 2) does not require any modification of the classifier model. 3) can be extended to perform further diagnosis (e.g. vulnerability assessment) and gain further understanding of the system. Experimental evaluation was conducted on the NSL-KDD99 benchmark dataset using Linear and Multilayer perceptron classifiers. The results are shown using intuitive visualizations in order to improve the interpretability of the results.},

  volume = {32},
  issn = {0219-3116},
  abstract = {Clusters of text documents output by clustering algorithms are often hard to interpret. We describe motivating real-world scenarios that necessitate reconfigurability and high interpretability of clusters and outline the problem of generating clusterings with interpretable and reconfigurable cluster models. We develop two clustering algorithms toward the outlined goal of building interpretable and reconfigurable cluster models. They generate clusters with associated rules that are composed of conditions on word occurrences or nonoccurrences. The proposed approaches vary in the complexity of the format of the rules; RGC employs disjunctions and conjunctions in rule generation whereas RGC-D rules are simple disjunctions of conditions signifying presence of various words. In both the cases, each cluster is comprised of precisely the set of documents that satisfy the corresponding rule. Rules of the latter kind are easy to interpret, whereas the former leads to more accurate clustering. We show that our approaches outperform the unsupervised decision tree approach for rule-generating clustering and also an approach we provide for generating interpretable models for general clusterings, both by significant margins. We empirically show that the purity and f-measure losses to achieve interpretability can be as little as 3 and 5\%, respectively using the algorithms presented herein.},

  title = {Hierarchical Interpretations for Neural Network Predictions},
  abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved impressive predictive performance due to their ability to learn complex, non-linear relationships between variables. However, the inability to effectively visualize these relationships has led to DNNs being characterized as black boxes and consequently limited their applications. To ameliorate this problem, we introduce the use of hierarchical interpretations to explain DNN predictions through our proposed method, agglomerative contextual decomposition (ACD). Given a prediction from a trained DNN, ACD produces a hierarchical clustering of the input features, along with the contribution of each cluster to the final prediction. This hierarchy is optimized to identify clusters of features that the DNN learned are predictive. Using examples from Stanford Sentiment Treebank and ImageNet, we show that ACD is effective at diagnosing incorrect predictions and identifying dataset bias. Through human experiments, we demonstrate that ACD enables users both to identify the more accurate of two DNNs and to better trust a DNN's outputs. We also find that ACD's hierarchy is largely robust to adversarial perturbations, implying that it captures fundamental aspects of the input and ignores spurious noise.},

However, in a high-dimensional feature space this approach may become unfeasible without restraining the set of important features. We propose to utilize the human tendency to ask questions like "Why this output (the fact) instead of that output (the foil)?" to reduce the number of features to those that play a main role in the asked contrast. Our proposed method utilizes locally trained one-versus-all decision trees to identify the disjoint set of rules that causes the tree to classify data points as the foil and not as the fact. In this study we illustrate this approach on three benchmark classification tasks.},

In this paper, we present a novel neural modular approach that performs compositional reasoning by automatically inducing a desired sub-task decomposition without relying on strong supervision. Our model allows linking different reasoning tasks though shared modules that handle common routines across tasks.

  abstract = {Generating machine learning models is inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. Two most common objectives are accuracy and interpretability, which are very likely conflicting with each other. While in most cases we are interested only in the model accuracy, interpretability of the model becomes the major concern if the model is used for data mining or if the model is applied to critical applications. In this chapter, we present a method for simultaneously generating accurate and interpretable neural network models for classification using an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm. Lifetime learning is embedded to fine-tune the weights in the evolution that mutates the structure and weights of the neural networks. The efficiency of Baldwin effect and Lamarckian evolution are compared. It is found that the Lamarckian evolution outperforms the Baldwin effect in evolutionary multi-objective optimization of neural networks. Simulation results on two benchmark problems demonstrate that the evolutionary multi-objective approach is able to generate both accurate and understandable neural network models, which can be used for different purpose.},

For example, safety-related applications for automation and control require that the correctness of the model must be ensured not only for the available data but for all possible input combinations. Thus, understanding what the model has learned and in particular how it will extrapolate to unseen data is a crucial concern. The paper discusses suitable learning methods for classification and regression. For classification problems, we review an approach based on an ensemble of nonlinear low-dimensional submodels, where each submodel is simple enough to be completely verified by domain experts. For regression problems, we review related approaches that try to achieve interpretability by using low-dimensional submodels (for instance, MARS and tree-growing methods). We compare them with symbolic regression, which is a different approach based on genetic algorithms. Finally, a novel approach is proposed for combining a symbolic regression model, which is shown to be easily interpretable, with a Gaussian Process. The combined model has an improved accuracy and provides error bounds in the sense that the deviation from the verified symbolic model is always kept below a defined limit.},

  abstract = {Recurrent neural networks have proven useful in natural language processing. For example, they can be trained to predict, and even generate plausible text with few or no spelling and syntax errors. However, it is not clear what grammar a network has learned, or how it keeps track of the syntactic structure of its input. In this paper, we present a new method to extract a finite state machine from a recurrent neural network. A FSM is in principle a more interpretable representation of a grammar than a neural net would be, however the extracted FSMs for realistic neural networks will also be large. Therefore, we also look at ways to group the states and paths through the extracted FSM so as to get a smaller, easier to understand model of the neural network. To illustrate our methods, we use them to investigate how a neural network learns noun-verb agreement from a simple grammar where relative clauses may appear between noun and verb.},

  abstract = {This paper demonstrates how case-based reasoning (CBR) can be used for an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach to justify solutions produced by an opaque learning method (i.e., target method), particularly in the context of unstructured textual data. Our general hypothesis is twofold: (1) There exists patterns in the relationship between problems and solutions and there should be data or a body of knowledge that describes how problems and solutions relate; and (2) the identification, manipulation, and learning of such patterns through case features can help create and reuse explanations for solutions produced by the target method. When the target method relies on neural network architectures (e.g., deep learning), the resulting latent space (i.e., word embeddings) becomes useful for finding patterns and semantic relatedness in textual data. In the proposed approach, case problems are input-output pairs from the target method, and case solutions are explanations. We exemplify our approach by explaining recommended citations from Citeomatic - a multi-layer neural-network architecture from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Citation analysis is the body of knowledge that describes how query documents (i.e., inputs) relate to recommended citations (i.e., outputs). We build cases and similarity assessment to learn features that represent patterns between problems and solutions that can lead to the reuse of corresponding explanations. The illustrative implementation we present becomes an explanation-augmented citation recommender that targets human-computer trust.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks have achieved promising prediction performance, but are often criticized for the lack of interpretability, which is essential in many real-world applications such as health informatics and political science. Meanwhile, it has been observed that many shallow models, such as linear models or tree-based models, are fairly interpretable though not accurate enough. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we investigate how to fully take advantage of the interpretability of shallow models in neural networks. To this end, we propose a novel interpretable neural model with Interactive Stepwise Influence (ISI) framework. Specifically, in each iteration of the learning process, ISI interactively trains a shallow model with soft labels computed from a neural network, and the learned shallow model is then used to influence the neural network to gain interpretability. Thus ISI could achieve interpretability in three aspects: importance of features, impact of feature value changes, and adaptability of feature weights in the neural network learning process. Experiments on both synthetic and two real-world datasets demonstrate that ISI could generate reliable interpretation with respect to the three aspects, as well as preserve prediction accuracy by comparing with other state-of-the-art methods.},

Although deep neural networks have exhibited superior performance in various tasks, interpretability is always Achilles' heel of deep neural networks. At present, deep neural networks obtain high discrimination power at the cost of a low interpretability of their black-box representations. We believe that high model interpretability may help people break several bottlenecks of deep learning, e.g., learning from a few annotations, learning via human\textendash{}computer communications at the semantic level, and semantically debugging network representations. We focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and revisit the visualization of CNN representations, methods of diagnosing representations of pre-trained CNNs, approaches for disentangling pre-trained CNN representations, learning of CNNs with disentangled representations, and middle-to-end learning based on model interpretability. Finally, we discuss prospective trends in explainable artificial intelligence.},

  title = {Attention {{Visualization}} of {{Gated Convolutional Neural Networks}} with {{Self Attention}} in {{Sentiment Analysis}}},
  abstract = {Deep learning is applied to many research topics; Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, and Acoustic Recognition. In deep learning, neural networks have a very complex and deep structure and it is difficult to discuss why they work well or not. So you have to take a trial-and-error to improve their performances. We develop a mechanism to show how neural networks predict final results and help you to design a new neural network architecture based on its prediction criteria. Speaking concrete, we visualize important features to predict the final results with an attentional mechanism. In this paper, we take up sentient analysis, which is one of natural language processing tasks. In image processing visualizing weights of a neural network is a major approach and you can obtain intuitive results; object outlines and object components. However, in natural language processing, the approach is not interpretable because a discriminate function constructed by a neural network is a complex and nonlinear one and it is very difficult to correlate weights and words in a text. We employ Gated Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) and introduce a self-attention mechanism to understand how GCNN determines sentiment polarities from raw reviews. GCNN can simulate an n-gram model and the self-attention mechanism can make correspondence between weights of a neural network and words clear. In experiments, we used Amazon reviews and evaluated the performance of the proposed method. Especially, the proposed method was able to emphasize some words in the review to determine sentiment polarity. Moreover, when the prediction was wrong, we were able to understand why the proposed method made mistakes because we found what words the proposed method emphasized.},

  abstract = {With the widespread applications of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), it becomes increasingly important for DCNNs not only to make accurate predictions but also to explain how they make their decisions. In this work, we propose a CHannel-wise disentangled InterPretation (CHIP) model to give the visual interpretation to the predictions of DCNNs. The proposed model distills the class-discriminative importance of channels in networks by utilizing the sparse regularization. Here, we first introduce the network perturbation technique to learn the model. The proposed model is capable to not only distill the global perspective knowledge from networks but also present the class-discriminative visual interpretation for specific predictions of networks. It is noteworthy that the proposed model is able to interpret different layers of networks without re-training. By combining the distilled interpretation knowledge in different layers, we further propose the Refined CHIP visual interpretation that is both high-resolution and class-discriminative. Experimental results on the standard dataset demonstrate that the proposed model provides promising visual interpretation for the predictions of networks in image classification task compared with existing visual interpretation methods. Besides, the proposed method outperforms related approaches in the application of ILSVRC 2015 weakly-supervised localization task.},

These deep models often suffer from a lack of interpretability \textendash{} they are particularly difficult to understand because of their non-linear nature. As a result, neural networks are often treated as ``black box'' models, and in the past, have been trained purely to optimize the accuracy of predictions. In this work, we create a novel network architecture for deep learning that naturally explains its own reasoning for each prediction. This architecture contains an autoencoder and a special prototype layer, where each unit of that layer stores a weight vector that resembles an encoded training input. The encoder of the autoencoder allows us to do comparisons within the latent space, while the decoder allows us to visualize the learned prototypes. The training objective has four terms: an accuracy term, a term that encourages every prototype to be similar to at least one encoded input, a term that encourages every encoded input to be close to at least one prototype, and a term that encourages faithful reconstruction by the autoencoder. The distances computed in the prototype layer are used as part of the classification process. Since the prototypes are learned during training, the learned network naturally comes with explanations for each prediction, and the explanations are loyal to what the network actually computes.},

Working within the framework of conformal methods, we propose a new measure of nonconformity suggested by our model, and experimentally validate the accompanying theoretical expectations, demonstrating improved transparency, controlled error rates, and robustness to out-of-domain data, without compromising on accuracy or calibration.},

  abstract = {Prediction accuracy and model explainability are the two most important objectives when developing machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems. The neural networks are known to possess good prediction performance, but lack of sufficient model explainability. In this paper, we propose to enhance the explainability of neural networks through the following architecture constraints: a) sparse additive subnetworks; b) orthogonal projection pursuit; and c) smooth function approximation. It leads to a sparse, orthogonal and smooth explainable neural network (SOSxNN). The multiple parameters in the SOSxNN model are simultaneously estimated by a modified mini-batch gradient descent algorithm based on the backpropagation technique for calculating the derivatives and the Cayley transform for preserving the projection orthogonality. The hyperparameters controlling the sparse and smooth constraints are optimized by the grid search. Through simulation studies, we compare the SOSxNN method to several benchmark methods including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, support vector machine, random forest, and multi-layer perceptron. It is shown that proposed model keeps the flexibility of pursuing prediction accuracy while attaining the improved interpretability, which can be therefore used as a promising surrogate model for complex model approximation. Finally, the real data example from the Lending Club is employed as a showcase of the SOSxNN application.},

Impressive examples of this development can be found in domains such as image classification, sentiment analysis, speech understanding or strategic game playing. However, because of their nested non-linear structure, these highly successful machine learning and artificial intelligence models are usually applied in a black box manner, i.e., no information is provided about what exactly makes them arrive at their predictions. Since this lack of transparency can be a major drawback, e.g., in medical applications, the development of methods for visualizing, explaining and interpreting deep learning models has recently attracted increasing attention. This paper summarizes recent developments in this field and makes a plea for more interpretability in artificial intelligence. Furthermore, it presents two approaches to explaining predictions of deep learning models, one method which computes the sensitivity of the prediction with respect to changes in the input and one approach which meaningfully decomposes the decision in terms of the input variables.

  abstract = {In today's legal environment, lawsuits and regulatory investigations require companies to embark upon increasingly intensive data-focused engagements to identify, collect and analyze large quantities of data. When documents are staged for review - where they are typically assessed for relevancy or privilege - the process can require companies to dedicate an extraordinary level of resources, both with respect to human resources, but also with respect to the use of technology-based techniques to intelligently sift through data. Companies regularly spend millions of dollars producing `responsive' electronically-stored documents for these types of matters. For several years, attorneys have been using a variety of tools to conduct this exercise, and most recently, they are accepting the use of machine learning techniques like text classification (referred to as predictive coding in the legal industry) to efficiently cull massive volumes of data to identify responsive documents for use in these matters. In recent years, a group of AI and Machine Learning researchers have been actively researching Explainable AI. In an explainable AI system, actions or decisions are human understandable. In typical legal `document review' scenarios, a document can be identified as responsive, as long as one or more of the text snippets (small passages of text) in a document are deemed responsive. In these scenarios, if predictive coding can be used to locate these responsive snippets, then attorneys could easily evaluate the model's document classification decision. When deployed with defined and explainable results, predictive coding can drastically enhance the overall quality and speed of the document review process by reducing the time it takes to review documents. Moreover, explainable predictive coding provides lawyers with greater confidence in the results of that supervised learning task. The authors of this paper propose the concept of explainable predictive coding and simple explainable predictive coding methods to locate responsive snippets within responsive documents. We also report our preliminary experimental results using the data from an actual legal matter that entailed this type of document review. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of explainable predictive coding in the context of professional services in the legal space.},

We analyze the typical bias-interpreting problem of the explainable model and develop prior losses to guide the learning of the explainable additive model. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract = {Complex problems may require sophisticated, non-linear learning methods such as kernel machines or deep neural networks to achieve state of the art prediction accuracies. However, high prediction accuracies are not the only objective to consider when solving problems using machine learning. Instead, particular scientific applications require some explanation of the learned prediction function. Unfortunately, most methods do not come with out of the box straight forward interpretation. Even linear prediction functions are not straight forward to explain if features exhibit complex correlation structure. In this paper, we propose the Measure of Feature Importance (MFI). MFI is general and can be applied to any arbitrary learning machine (including kernel machines and deep learning). MFI is intrinsically non-linear and can detect features that by itself are inconspicuous and only impact the prediction function through their interaction with other features. Lastly, MFI can be used for both --- model-based feature importance and instance-based feature importance (i.e, measuring the importance of a feature for a particular data point).},

Current textual explanations learn to discuss class discriminative features in an image. However, it is also helpful to understand which attributes might change a classification decision if present in an image (e.g., ``This is not a Scarlet Tanager because it does not have black wings.'') We call such textual explanations counterfactual explanations, and propose an intuitive method to generate counterfactual explanations by inspecting which evidence in an input is missing, but might contribute to a different classification decision if present in the image. To demonstrate our method we consider a fine-grained image classification task in which we take as input an image and a counterfactual class and output text which explains why the image does not belong to a counterfactual class. We then analyze our generated counterfactual explanations both qualitatively and quantitatively using proposed automatic metrics.},

While local explanation methods exist for one prediction, most global attributions still reduce neural network decisions to a single set of features. In response, we present an approach for generating global attributions called GAM, which explains the landscape of neural network predictions across subpopulations. GAM augments global explanations with the proportion of samples that each attribution best explains and specifies which samples are described by each attribution. Global explanations also have tunable granularity to detect more or fewer subpopulations. We demonstrate that GAM's global explanations 1) yield the known feature importances of simulated data, 2) match feature weights of interpretable statistical models on real data, and 3) are intuitive to practitioners through user studies. With more transparent predictions, GAM can help ensure neural network decisions are generated for the right reasons.},

The success of the module relies on the assumption that the network's computation and reasoning is represented in its internal layer activations. While in principle InterpNET could be applied to any existing classification architecture, it is evaluated via an image classification and explanation task. Experiments on a CUB bird classification and explanation dataset show qualitatively and quantitatively that the model is able to generate high-quality explanations.

The recent movement for ``algorithmic fairness'' also stipulates explainability, and therefore interpretability of learning models. And yet the most successful contemporary Machine Learning approaches, the Deep Neural Networks, produce models that are highly non-interpretable. We attempt to address this challenge by proposing a technique called CNN-INTE to interpret deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) via meta-learning. In this work, we interpret a specific hidden layer of the deep CNN model on the MNIST image dataset. We use a clustering algorithm in a two-level structure to find the meta-level training data and Random Forest as base learning algorithms to generate the meta-level test data. The interpretation results are displayed visually via diagrams, which clearly indicates how a specific test instance is classified. Our method achieves global interpretation for all the test instances on the hidden layers without sacrificing the accuracy obtained by the original deep CNN model. This means our model is faithful to the original deep CNN model, which leads to reliable interpretations.},

Unlike previously proposed local methods which try to explain particular classification decisions, we focus on global interpretability and ask a universally applicable question: given a trained model, which features are the most important? In the context of neural networks, a feature is rarely important on its own, so our strategy is specifically designed to leverage partial covariance structures and incorporate variable dependence into feature ranking. Our methodological contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, we propose an effect size analogue for DNNs that is appropriate for applications with highly collinear predictors (ubiquitous in computer vision). Second, we extend the recently proposed ``RelATive cEntrality'' (RATE) measure (Crawford et al., 2019) to the Bayesian deep learning setting. RATE applies an information theoretic criterion to the posterior distribution of effect sizes to assess feature significance. We apply our framework to three broad application areas: computer vision, natural language processing, and social science.},

We present Manifold, a framework that utilizes visual analysis techniques to support interpretation, debugging, and comparison of machine learning models in a more transparent and interactive manner. Conventional techniques usually focus on visualizing the internal logic of a specific model type (i.e., deep neural networks), lacking the ability to extend to a more complex scenario where different model types are integrated. To this end, Manifold is designed as a generic framework that does not rely on or access the internal logic of the model and solely observes the input (i.e., instances or features) and the output (i.e., the predicted result and probability distribution). We describe the workflow of Manifold as an iterative process consisting of three major phases that are commonly involved in the model development and diagnosis process: inspection (hypothesis), explanation (reasoning), and refinement (verification). The visual components supporting these tasks include a scatterplot-based visual summary that overviews the models' outcome and a customizable tabular view that reveals feature discrimination. We demonstrate current applications of the framework on the classification and regression tasks and discuss other potential machine learning use scenarios where Manifold can be applied.},

Thus, interpretability has become a vital concern in machine learning, and work in the area of interpretable models has found renewed interest. In some applications, such models are as accurate as non-interpretable ones, and thus are preferred for their transparency. Even when they are not accurate, they may still be preferred when interpretability is of paramount importance. However, restricting machine learning to interpretable models is often a severe limitation. In this paper we argue for explaining machine learning predictions using model-agnostic approaches. By treating the machine learning models as black-box functions, these approaches provide crucial flexibility in the choice of models, explanations, and representations, improving debugging, comparison, and interfaces for a variety of users and models.

For practitioners, interpretability plays a critical role in model explanation, model validation, and model improvement to develop a faithful model. In the paper, we propose a novel Multi-scale INTerpretation (MINT) model for convolutional neural networks using both the perturbation-based and the gradient-based interpretation approaches. It learns the class-discriminative interpretable knowledge from the multi-scale perturbation of feature information in different layers of deep networks. The proposed MINT model provides the coarse-scale and the fine-scale interpretations for the attention in the deep layer and specific features in the shallow layer, respectively.

  abstract = {At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, we are witnessing a fast and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily life, which contributes to accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society. However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.},

  abstract = {Understanding the behavior of a trained network and finding explanations for its outputs is important for improving the network's performance and generalization ability, and for ensuring trust in automated systems. Several approaches have previously been proposed to identify and visualize the most important features by analyzing a trained network. However, the relations between different features and classes are lost in most cases. We propose a technique to induce sets of if-then-else rules that capture these relations to globally explain the predictions of a network. We first calculate the importance of the features in the trained network. We then weigh the original inputs with these feature importance scores, simplify the transformed input space, and finally fit a rule induction model to explain the model predictions. We find that the output rule-sets can explain the predictions of a neural network trained for 4-class text classification from the 20 newsgroups dataset to a macro-averaged F-score of 0.80. We make the code available at https://github.com/ clips/interpret\_with\_rules.},

The difficulty of interpreting the predictions of a neural network often prevents its use in fields where explainability is important, such as the financial industry where regulators and auditors often insist on this aspect. In this paper, we present a way to assess the relative input features importance of a neural network based on the sensitivity of the model output with respect to its input. This method has the advantage of being fast to compute, it can provide both global and local levels of explanations and is applicable for many types of neural network architectures. We illustrate the performance of this method on both synthetic and real data and compare it with other interpretation techniques. This method is implemented into an open-source Python package that allows its users to easily generate and visualize explanations for their neural networks.},

The opaqueness results in uncertainty and low confidence when deploying such a model in model sharing scenarios, where the model is developed by a third party. For a supervised machine learning model, sharing training process including training data is a way to gain trust and to better understand model predictions. However, it is not always possible to share all training data due to privacy and policy constraints. In this paper, we propose a method to disclose a small set of training data that is just sufficient for users to get the insight into a complicated model. The method constructs a boundary tree using selected training data and the tree is able to approximate the complicated deep neural network models with high fidelity. We show that data point pairs in the tree give users significantly better understanding of the model decision boundaries and paves the way for trustworthy model sharing.},

  abstract = {Deep learning is increasingly used in decision-making tasks. However, understanding how neural networks produce final predictions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing work on interpreting neural network predictions for images often focuses on explaining predictions for single images or neurons. As predictions are often computed based off of millions of weights that are optimized over millions of images, such explanations can easily miss a bigger picture. We present SUMMIT, the first interactive system that scalably and systematically summarizes and visualizes what features a deep learning model has learned and how those features interact to make predictions. SUMMIT introduces two new scalable summarization techniques: (1) activation aggregation discovers important neurons, and (2) neuron-influence aggregation identifies relationships among such neurons. SUMMIT combines these techniques to create the novel attribution graph that reveals and summarizes crucial neuron associations and substructures that contribute to a model's outcomes. SUMMIT scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images, and leverages neural network feature visualization and dataset examples to help users distill large, complex neural network models into compact, interactive visualizations. We present neural network exploration scenarios where SUMMIT helps us discover multiple surprising insights into a state-of-the-art image classifier's learned representations and informs future neural network architecture design. The SUMMIT visualization runs in modern web browsers and is open-sourced.},

The final phase is important because it can provide a trained connectionist architecture with explanation power and validate its output decisions. Moreover, it can be used to refine and maintain the initial knowledge acquired from domain experts. In this paper, we present three rule extraction techniques. The first technique extracts a set of binary rules from any type of neural network. The other two techniques are specific to feedforward networks, with a single hidden layer of sigmoidal units. Technique 2 extracts partial rules that represent the most important embedded knowledge with an adjustable level of detail, while the third technique provides a more comprehensive and universal approach. A rule-evaluation technique, which orders extracted rules based on three performance measures, is then proposed. The three techniques area applied to the iris and breast cancer data sets. The extracted rules are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively, and are compared with those obtained by other approaches.},

To investigate their effects, we deployed these explanations to 1150 users on QuickDraw, an online platform where users draw images and see whether a recognizer has correctly guessed the intended drawing. When the algorithm failed to recognize the drawing, those who received normative explanations felt they had a better understanding of the system, and perceived the system to have higher capability. However, comparative explanations did not always improve perceptions of the algorithm, possibly because they sometimes exposed limitations of the algorithm and may have led to surprise. These findings suggest that examples can serve as a vehicle for explaining algorithmic behavior, but point to relative advantages and disadvantages of using different kinds of examples, depending on the goal.},

To solve this problem, transfer learning reuses the pretrained model on a new task. However, one weakness of transfer learning is that it applies a pretrained model to a new task without understanding the output of an existing model. This may cause a lack of interpretability in training deep neural network. In this paper, we propose a technique to improve the interpretability in transfer learning tasks. We define the interpretable features and use it to train model to a new task. Thus, we will be able to explain the relationship between the source and target domain in a transfer learning task.

  abstract = {Neural networks are among the most accurate supervised learning methods in use today. However, their opacity makes them difficult to trust in critical applications, especially when conditions in training may differ from those in practice. Recent efforts to develop explanations for neural networks and machine learning models more generally have produced tools to shed light on the implicit rules behind predictions. These tools can help us identify when models are right for the wrong reasons. However, they do not always scale to explaining predictions for entire datasets, are not always at the right level of abstraction, and most importantly cannot correct the problems they reveal. In this thesis, we explore the possibility of training machine learning models (with a particular focus on neural networks) using explanations themselves. We consider approaches where models are penalized not only for making incorrect predictions but also for providing explanations that are either inconsistent with domain knowledge or overly complex. These methods let us train models which can not only provide more interpretable rationales for their predictions but also generalize better when training data is confounded or meaningfully different from test data (even adversarially so).},

  abstract = {A neuroscience method to understanding the brain is to find and study the preferred stimuli that highly activate an individual cell or groups of cells. Recent advances in machine learning enable a family of methods to synthesize preferred stimuli that cause a neuron in an artificial or biological brain to fire strongly. Those methods are known as Activation Maximization (AM) [ ] or Feature Visualization via Optimization. In this chapter, we ( ) review existing AM techniques in the literature; ( ) discuss a probabilistic interpretation for AM; and ( ) review the applications of AM in debugging and explaining networks.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an unsupervised method to learn a neural network, namely an explainer, to interpret a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), i.e. explaining knowledge representations hidden in middle conv-layers of the CNN. Given feature maps of a certain conv-layer of the CNN, the explainer performs like an auto-encoder, which first disentangles the feature maps into object-part features and then inverts object-part features back to features of higher conv-layers of the CNN. More specifically, the explainer contains interpretable conv-layers, where each filter disentangles the representation of a specific object part from chaotic input feature maps. As a paraphrase of CNN features, the disentangled representations of object parts help people understand the logic inside the CNN. We also learn the explainer to use object-part features to reconstruct features of higher CNN layers, in order to minimize loss of information during the feature disentanglement. More crucially, we learn the explainer via network distillation without using any annotations of sample labels, object parts, or textures for supervision. We have applied our method to different types of CNNs for evaluation, and explainers have significantly boosted the interpretability of CNN features.},

  title = {Visualizing {{Deep Neural Networks}} for {{Text Analytics}}},
  abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in many different areas in recent years. How these networks function internally, however, is often not well understood. Advances in under-standing DNNs will benefit and accelerate the development of the field. We present TNNVis, a visualization system that supports un-derstanding of deep neural networks specifically designed to analyze text. TNNVis focuses on DNNs composed of fully connected and convolutional layers. It integrates visual encodings and interaction techniques chosen specifically for our tasks. The tool allows users to: (1) visually explore DNN models with arbitrary input using a combination of node-link diagrams and matrix representation; (2) quickly identify activation values, weights, and feature map patterns within a network; (3) flexibly focus on visual information of interest with threshold, inspection, insight query, and tooltip operations; (4) discover network activation and training patterns through animation; and (5) compare differences between internal activation patterns for different inputs to the DNN. These functions allow neural network researchers to examine their DNN models from new perspectives, producing insights on how these models function. Clustering and summarization techniques are employed to support large convolutional and fully connected layers. Based on several part of speech models with different structure and size, we present multiple use cases where visualization facilitates an understanding of the models.},

  abstract = {Interpretation and explanation of deep models is critical towards wide adoption of systems that rely on them. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for both interpretation as well as explanation in which, given a pretrained model, we automatically identify internal features relevant for the set of classes considered by the model, without relying on additional annotations. We interpret the model through average visualizations of this reduced set of features. Then, at test time, we explain the network prediction by accompanying the predicted class label with supporting visualizations derived from the identified features. In addition, we propose a method to address the artifacts introduced by strided operations in deconvNetbased visualizations. Moreover, we introduce an8Flower, a dataset specifically designed for objective quantitative evaluation of methods for visual explanation. Experiments on the MNIST, ILSVRC12, Fashion144k and an8Flower datasets show that our method produces detailed explanations with good coverage of relevant features of the classes of interest.},

  abstract = {Text documents can be described by a number of abstract concepts such as semantic category, writing style, or sentiment. Machine learning (ML) models have been trained to automatically map documents to these abstract concepts, allowing to annotate very large text collections, more than could be processed by a human in a lifetime. Besides predicting the text's category very accurately, it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the categorization process takes place. In this paper, we demonstrate that such understanding can be achieved by tracing the classification decision back to individual words using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), a recently developed technique for explaining predictions of complex non-linear classifiers. We train two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, on a topic categorization task and adapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words. Resulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall classification decision. This enables one to distill relevant information from text documents without an explicit semantic information extraction step. We further use the word-wise relevance scores for generating novel vector-based document representations which capture semantic information. Based on these document vectors, we introduce a measure of model explanatory power and show that, although the SVM and CNN models perform similarly in terms of classification accuracy, the latter exhibits a higher level of explainability which makes it more comprehensible for humans and potentially more useful for other applications.},

  abstract = {By their nature, the composition of black box models is opaque. This makes the ability to generate explanations for the response to stimuli challenging. The importance of explaining black box models has become increasingly important given the prevalence of AI and ML systems and the need to build legal and regulatory frameworks around them. Such explanations can also increase trust in these uncertain systems. In our paper we present RICE, a method for generating explanations of the behaviour of black box models by (1) probing a model to extract model output examples using sensitivity analysis; (2) applying CNPInduce, a method for inductive logic program synthesis, to generate logic programs based on critical input-output pairs; and (3) interpreting the target program as a human-readable explanation. We demonstrate the application of our method by generating explanations of an artificial neural network trained to follow simple traffic rules in a hypothetical self-driving car simulation. We conclude with a discussion on the scalability and usability of our approach and its potential applications to explanation-critical scenarios.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel approach to feed-forward neural network interpretation based on partitioning the space of sequences of neuron activations. In line with this approach, we propose a model-specific interpretation method, called YASENN. Our method inherits many advantages of modelagnostic distillation, such as an ability to focus on the particular input region and to express an explanation in terms of features different from those observed by a neural network. Moreover, examination of distillation error makes the method applicable to the problems with low tolerance to interpretation mistakes. Technically, YASENN distills the network with an ensemble of layer-wise gradient boosting decision trees and encodes the sequences of neuron activations with leaf indices. The finite number of unique codes induces a partitioning of the input space. Each partition may be described in a variety of ways, including examination of an interpretable model (e.g. a logistic regression or a decision tree) trained to discriminate between objects of those partitions. Our experiments provide an intuition behind the method and demonstrate revealed artifacts in neural network decision making.},

  abstract = {In the context of post-hoc interpretability, this paper addresses the task of explaining the prediction of a classifier, considering the case where no information is available, neither on the classifier itself, nor on the processed data (neither the training nor the test data). It proposes an inverse classification approach whose principle consists in determining the minimal changes needed to alter a prediction: in an instance-based framework, given a data point whose classification must be explained, the proposed method consists in identifying a close neighbor classified differently, where the closeness definition integrates a sparsity constraint. This principle is implemented using observation generation in the Growing Spheres algorithm. Experimental results on two datasets illustrate the relevance of the proposed approach that can be used to gain knowledge about the classifier.},

We propose a generic framework as well as a concrete method for quantifying the influence of individual input signals on the output computed by a deep neural network. Inspired by the variable weighting scheme in the log-linear combination of variables in logistic regression, the proposed method provides linear models for specific observations of the input variables. This linear model locally approximates the behaviour of the neural network and can be used to quantify the influence of input variables in a principled way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets.},
