 abstract = {Hybrid intelligent systems that combine knowledge-based and artificial neural network systems typically have four phases, involving domain knowledge representation, mapping of this knowledge into an initial connectionist architecture, network training and rule extraction, respectively. The final phase is important because it can provide a trained connectionist architecture with explanation power and validate its output decisions. Moreover, it can be used to refine and maintain the initial knowledge acquired from domain experts. In this paper, we present three rule extraction techniques. The first technique extracts a set of binary rules from any type of neural network. The other two techniques are specific to feedforward networks, with a single hidden layer of sigmoidal units. Technique 2 extracts partial rules that represent the most important embedded knowledge with an adjustable level of detail, while the third technique provides a more comprehensive and universal approach. A rule-evaluation technique, which orders extracted rules based on three performance measures, is then proposed. The three techniques area applied to the iris and breast cancer data sets. The extracted rules are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively, and are compared with those obtained by other approaches.},

Many people apply machine learning for a variety of domains for various purposes, such as classification of opinions. However, the constructed models of machine learning are black boxes. They cannot understand the background reason for their decisions. In many cases, understanding the reasons important. In this paper, we focus on interpretation of models and understanding of decision reasons.

Advances in under-standing DNNs will benefit and accelerate the development of the field. We present TNNVis, a visualization system that supports un-derstanding of deep neural networks specifically designed to analyze text. TNNVis focuses on DNNs composed of fully connected and convolutional layers. It integrates visual encodings and interaction techniques chosen specifically for our tasks. The tool allows users to: (1) visually explore DNN models with arbitrary input using a combination of node-link diagrams and matrix representation; (2) quickly identify activation values, weights, and feature map patterns within a network; (3) flexibly focus on visual information of interest with threshold, inspection, insight query, and tooltip operations; (4) discover network activation and training patterns through animation; and (5) compare differences between internal activation patterns for different inputs to the DNN. These functions allow neural network researchers to examine their DNN models from new perspectives, producing insights on how these models function. Clustering and summarization techniques are employed to support large convolutional and fully connected layers. Based on several part of speech models with different structure and size, we present multiple use cases where visualization facilitates an understanding of the models.},

 abstract = {Interpretation and diagnosis of machine learning models have gained renewed interest in recent years with breakthroughs in new approaches. We present Manifold, a framework that utilizes visual analysis techniques to support interpretation, debugging, and comparison of machine learning models in a more transparent and interactive manner. Conventional techniques usually focus on visualizing the internal logic of a specific model type (i.e., deep neural networks), lacking the ability to extend to a more complex scenario where different model types are integrated. To this end, Manifold is designed as a generic framework that does not rely on or access the internal logic of the model and solely observes the input (i.e., instances or features) and the output (i.e., the predicted result and probability distribution). We describe the workflow of Manifold as an iterative process consisting of three major phases that are commonly involved in the model development and diagnosis process: inspection (hypothesis), explanation (reasoning), and refinement (verification). The visual components supporting these tasks include a scatterplot-based visual summary that overviews the models' outcome and a customizable tabular view that reveals feature discrimination. We demonstrate current applications of the framework on the classification and regression tasks and discuss other potential machine learning use scenarios where Manifold can be applied.},

However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI.

 abstract = {Model interpretability is a requirement in many applications in which crucial decisions are made by users relying on a model's outputs. The recent movement for “algorithmic fairness” also stipulates explainability, and therefore interpretability of learning models. And yet the most successful contemporary Machine Learning approaches, the Deep Neural Networks, produce models that are highly non-interpretable. We attempt to address this challenge by proposing a technique called CNN-INTE to interpret deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) via meta-learning. In this work, we interpret a specific hidden layer of the deep CNN model on the MNIST image dataset. We use a clustering algorithm in a two-level structure to find the meta-level training data and Random Forest as base learning algorithms to generate the meta-level test data. The interpretation results are displayed visually via diagrams, which clearly indicates how a specific test instance is classified. Our method achieves global interpretation for all the test instances on the hidden layers without sacrificing the accuracy obtained by the original deep CNN model. This means our model is faithful to the original deep CNN model, which leads to reliable interpretations.},

Adversarial machine learning offers an approach to increase our understanding of these models. In this paper we present an approach to generate explanations for incorrect classifications made by data-driven Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) An adversarial approach is used to find the minimum modifications (of the input features) required to correctly classify a given set of misclassified samples. The magnitude of such modifications is used to visualize the most relevant features that explain the reason for the misclassification. The presented methodology generated satisfactory explanations that describe the reasoning behind the mis-classifications, with descriptions that match expert knowledge. The advantages of the presented methodology are: 1) applicable to any classifier with defined gradients. 2) does not require any modification of the classifier model. 3) can be extended to perform further diagnosis (e.g. vulnerability assessment) and gain further understanding of the system. Experimental evaluation was conducted on the NSL-KDD99 benchmark dataset using Linear and Multilayer perceptron classifiers. The results are shown using intuitive visualizations in order to improve the interpretability of the results.},

 abstract = {Deep learning is applied to many research topics; Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, and Acoustic Recognition. In deep learning, neural networks have a very complex and deep structure and it is difficult to discuss why they work well or not. So you have to take a trial-and-error to improve their performances. We develop a mechanism to show how neural networks predict final results and help you to design a new neural network architecture based on its prediction criteria. Speaking concrete, we visualize important features to predict the final results with an attentional mechanism. In this paper, we take up sentient analysis, which is one of natural language processing tasks. In image processing visualizing weights of a neural network is a major approach and you can obtain intuitive results; object outlines and object components. However, in natural language processing, the approach is not interpretable because a discriminate function constructed by a neural network is a complex and nonlinear one and it is very difficult to correlate weights and words in a text. We employ Gated Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) and introduce a self-attention mechanism to understand how GCNN determines sentiment polarities from raw reviews. GCNN can simulate an n-gram model and the self-attention mechanism can make correspondence between weights of a neural network and words clear. In experiments, we used Amazon reviews and evaluated the performance of the proposed method. Especially, the proposed method was able to emphasize some words in the review to determine sentiment polarity. Moreover, when the prediction was wrong, we were able to understand why the proposed method made mistakes because we found what words the proposed method emphasized.},

 abstract = {In today's legal environment, lawsuits and regulatory investigations require companies to embark upon increasingly intensive data-focused engagements to identify, collect and analyze large quantities of data. When documents are staged for review - where they are typically assessed for relevancy or privilege - the process can require companies to dedicate an extraordinary level of resources, both with respect to human resources, but also with respect to the use of technology-based techniques to intelligently sift through data. Companies regularly spend millions of dollars producing `responsive' electronically-stored documents for these types of matters. For several years, attorneys have been using a variety of tools to conduct this exercise, and most recently, they are accepting the use of machine learning techniques like text classification (referred to as predictive coding in the legal industry) to efficiently cull massive volumes of data to identify responsive documents for use in these matters. In recent years, a group of AI and Machine Learning researchers have been actively researching Explainable AI. In an explainable AI system, actions or decisions are human understandable. In typical legal `document review' scenarios, a document can be identified as responsive, as long as one or more of the text snippets (small passages of text) in a document are deemed responsive. In these scenarios, if predictive coding can be used to locate these responsive snippets, then attorneys could easily evaluate the model's document classification decision. When deployed with defined and explainable results, predictive coding can drastically enhance the overall quality and speed of the document review process by reducing the time it takes to review documents. Moreover, explainable predictive coding provides lawyers with greater confidence in the results of that supervised learning task. The authors of this paper propose the concept of explainable predictive coding and simple explainable predictive coding methods to locate responsive snippets within responsive documents. We also report our preliminary experimental results using the data from an actual legal matter that entailed this type of document review. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of explainable predictive coding in the context of professional services in the legal space.},

To tackle this challenge, model interpretability is essential and has been investigated in a wide range of applications. For end users, model interpretability can be used to build trust in the deployed machine learning models. For practitioners, interpretability plays a critical role in model explanation, model validation, and model improvement to develop a faithful model. In the paper, we propose a novel Multi-scale INTerpretation (MINT) model for convolutional neural networks using both the perturbation-based and the gradient-based interpretation approaches. It learns the class-discriminative interpretable knowledge from the multi-scale perturbation of feature information in different layers of deep networks. The proposed MINT model provides the coarse-scale and the fine-scale interpretations for the attention in the deep layer and specific features in the shallow layer, respectively. Experimental results show that the MINT model presents the class-discriminative interpretation of the network decision and explains the significance of the hierarchical network structure.},

However, one weakness of transfer learning is that it applies a pretrained model to a new task without understanding the output of an existing model. This may cause a lack of interpretability in training deep neural network. In this paper, we propose a technique to improve the interpretability in transfer learning tasks. We define the interpretable features and use it to train model to a new task. Thus, we will be able to explain the relationship between the source and target domain in a transfer learning task.

 abstract = {Clusters of text documents output by clustering algorithms are often hard to interpret. We describe motivating real-world scenarios that necessitate reconfigurability and high interpretability of clusters and outline the problem of generating clusterings with interpretable and reconfigurable cluster models. We develop two clustering algorithms toward the outlined goal of building interpretable and reconfigurable cluster models. They generate clusters with associated rules that are composed of conditions on word occurrences or nonoccurrences. The proposed approaches vary in the complexity of the format of the rules; RGC employs disjunctions and conjunctions in rule generation whereas RGC-D rules are simple disjunctions of conditions signifying presence of various words. In both the cases, each cluster is comprised of precisely the set of documents that satisfy the corresponding rule. Rules of the latter kind are easy to interpret, whereas the former leads to more accurate clustering. We show that our approaches outperform the unsupervised decision tree approach for rule-generating clustering and also an approach we provide for generating interpretable models for general clusterings, both by significant margins. We empirically show that the purity and f-measure losses to achieve interpretability can be as little as 3 and 5\%, respectively using the algorithms presented herein.},

 abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black
boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite
important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action
based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such
understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to
transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this
work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the
predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by
learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose
a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions
and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular
optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by
explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image
classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via
novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios
that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between
models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier
should not be trusted.},

both system designers and end-users in many ways: in model selection, feature
engineering, in order to trust and act upon the predictions, and in more
intuitive user interfaces. Thus, interpretability has become a vital concern in
machine learning, and work in the area of interpretable models has found
renewed interest. In some applications, such models are as accurate as
non-interpretable ones, and thus are preferred for their transparency. Even
when they are not accurate, they may still be preferred when interpretability
is of paramount importance. However, restricting machine learning to
interpretable models is often a severe limitation. In this paper we argue for
explaining machine learning predictions using model-agnostic approaches. By
treating the machine learning models as black-box functions, these approaches
provide crucial flexibility in the choice of models, explanations, and
representations, improving debugging, comparison, and interfaces for a variety
of users and models. We also outline the main challenges for such methods, and
review a recently-introduced model-agnostic explanation approach (LIME) that

 abstract = {Complex problems may require sophisticated, non-linear learning methods such
as kernel machines or deep neural networks to achieve state of the art

objective to consider when solving problems using machine learning. Instead,
particular scientific applications require some explanation of the learned

straight forward to explain if features exhibit complex correlation structure.
In this paper, we propose the Measure of Feature Importance (MFI). MFI is
general and can be applied to any arbitrary learning machine (including kernel
machines and deep learning). MFI is intrinsically non-linear and can detect
features that by itself are inconspicuous and only impact the prediction
function through their interaction with other features. Lastly, MFI can be used
for both --- model-based feature importance and instance-based feature
importance (i.e, measuring the importance of a feature for a particular data
point).},

 abstract = {Text documents can be described by a number of abstract concepts such as
semantic category, writing style, or sentiment. Machine learning (ML) models
have been trained to automatically map documents to these abstract concepts,
allowing to annotate very large text collections, more than could be processed
by a human in a lifetime. Besides predicting the text's category very
accurately, it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the
categorization process takes place. In this paper, we demonstrate that such
understanding can be achieved by tracing the classification decision back to
individual words using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), a recently
developed technique for explaining predictions of complex non-linear
classifiers. We train two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, on a topic categorization task and
adapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words.
Resulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall
classification decision. This enables one to distill relevant information from
text documents without an explicit semantic information extraction step. We
further use the word-wise relevance scores for generating novel vector-based
document representations which capture semantic information. Based on these
document vectors, we introduce a measure of model explanatory power and show
that, although the SVM and CNN models perform similarly in terms of
classification accuracy, the latter exhibits a higher level of explainability
which makes it more comprehensible for humans and potentially more useful for
other applications.},

us to do comparisons within the latent space, while the decoder allows us to
visualize the learned prototypes. The training objective has four terms: an
accuracy term, a term that encourages every prototype to be similar to at least
one encoded input, a term that encourages every encoded input to be close to at
least one prototype, and a term that encourages faithful reconstruction by the
autoencoder. The distances computed in the prototype layer are used as part of
the classification process. Since the prototypes are learned during training,
the learned network naturally comes with explanations for each prediction, and
the explanations are loyal to what the network actually computes.},

technique called CNN-INTE to interpret deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
via meta-learning. In this work, we interpret a specific hidden layer of the
deep CNN model on the MNIST image dataset. We use a clustering algorithm in a
two-level structure to find the meta-level training data and Random Forest as
base learning algorithms to generate the meta-level test data. The
interpretation results are displayed visually via diagrams, which clearly
indicates how a specific test instance is classified. Our method achieves
global interpretation for all the test instances without sacrificing the
accuracy obtained by the original deep CNN model. This means our model is
faithful to the deep CNN model, which leads to reliable interpretations.},

along with the contribution of each cluster to the final prediction. This
hierarchy is optimized to identify clusters of features that the DNN learned

we show that ACD is effective at diagnosing incorrect predictions and
identifying dataset bias. Through human experiments, we demonstrate that ACD
enables users both to identify the more accurate of two DNNs and to better
trust a DNN's outputs. We also find that ACD's hierarchy is largely robust to
adversarial perturbations, implying that it captures fundamental aspects of the

 abstract = {While the success of deep neural networks (DNNs) is well-established across a
variety of domains, our ability to explain and interpret these methods is
limited. Unlike previously proposed local methods which try to explain
particular classification decisions, we focus on global interpretability and
ask a universally applicable question: given a trained model, which features
are the most important? In the context of neural networks, a feature is rarely
important on its own, so our strategy is specifically designed to leverage
partial covariance structures and incorporate variable dependence into feature
ranking. Our methodological contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, we
propose an effect size analogue for DNNs that is appropriate for applications
with highly collinear predictors (ubiquitous in computer vision). Second, we
extend the recently proposed "RelATive cEntrality" (RATE) measure (Crawford et
al., 2019) to the Bayesian deep learning setting. RATE applies an information
theoretic criterion to the posterior distribution of effect sizes to assess
feature significance. We apply our framework to three broad application areas:
computer vision, natural language processing, and social science.},

 abstract = {A barrier to the wider adoption of neural networks is their lack of
interpretability. While local explanation methods exist for one prediction,
most global attributions still reduce neural network decisions to a single set
of features. In response, we present an approach for generating global
attributions called GAM, which explains the landscape of neural network
predictions across subpopulations. GAM augments global explanations with the
proportion of samples that each attribution best explains and specifies which
samples are described by each attribution. Global explanations also have
tunable granularity to detect more or fewer subpopulations. We demonstrate that
GAM's global explanations 1) yield the known feature importances of simulated
data, 2) match feature weights of interpretable statistical models on real
data, and 3) are intuitive to practitioners through user studies. With more
transparent predictions, GAM can help ensure neural network decisions are
generated for the right reasons.},

 abstract = {With the widespread applications of deep convolutional neural networks
(DCNNs), it becomes increasingly important for DCNNs not only to make accurate
predictions but also to explain how they make their decisions. In this work, we
propose a CHannel-wise disentangled InterPretation (CHIP) model to give the
visual interpretation to the predictions of DCNNs. The proposed model distills
the class-discriminative importance of channels in networks by utilizing the
sparse regularization. Here, we first introduce the network perturbation
technique to learn the model. The proposed model is capable to not only distill
the global perspective knowledge from networks but also present the
class-discriminative visual interpretation for specific predictions of
networks. It is noteworthy that the proposed model is able to interpret
different layers of networks without re-training. By combining the distilled
interpretation knowledge in different layers, we further propose the Refined
CHIP visual interpretation that is both high-resolution and
class-discriminative. Experimental results on the standard dataset demonstrate
that the proposed model provides promising visual interpretation for the
predictions of networks in image classification task compared with existing
visual interpretation methods. Besides, the proposed method outperforms related
approaches in the application of ILSVRC 2015 weakly-supervised localization

 abstract = {Deep learning is increasingly used in decision-making tasks. However,
understanding how neural networks produce final predictions remains a
fundamental challenge. Existing work on interpreting neural network predictions
for images often focuses on explaining predictions for single images or
neurons. As predictions are often computed based off of millions of weights
that are optimized over millions of images, such explanations can easily miss a
bigger picture. We present Summit, the first interactive system that scalably
and systematically summarizes and visualizes what features a deep learning
model has learned and how those features interact to make predictions. Summit
introduces two new scalable summarization techniques: (1) activation
aggregation discovers important neurons, and (2) neuron-influence aggregation
identifies relationships among such neurons. Summit combines these techniques
to create the novel attribution graph that reveals and summarizes crucial
neuron associations and substructures that contribute to a model's outcomes.
Summit scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images, and
leverages neural network feature visualization and dataset examples to help
users distill large, complex neural network models into compact, interactive
visualizations. We present neural network exploration scenarios where Summit
helps us discover multiple surprising insights into a state-of-the-art image
classifier's learned representations and informs future neural network

Existing models designed to produce interpretable traces of their decision-making process typically require these traces to be supervised at training time. In this paper, we present a novel neural modular approach that performs compositional reasoning by automatically inducing a desired sub-task decomposition without relying on strong supervision. Our model allows linking different reasoning tasks though shared modules that handle common routines across tasks. Experiments show that the model is more interpretable to human evaluators compared to other state-of-the-art models: users can better understand the model's underlying reasoning procedure and predict when it will succeed or fail based on observing its intermediate outputs.},

Two most common objectives are accuracy and interpretability, which are very likely conflicting with each other. While in most cases we are interested only in the model accuracy, interpretability of the model becomes the major concern if the model is used for data mining or if the model is applied to critical applications. In this chapter, we present a method for simultaneously generating accurate and interpretable neural network models for classification using an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm. Lifetime learning is embedded to fine-tune the weights in the evolution that mutates the structure and weights of the neural networks. The efficiency of Baldwin effect and Lamarckian evolution are compared. It is found that the Lamarckian evolution outperforms the Baldwin effect in evolutionary multi-objective optimization of neural networks. Simulation results on two benchmark problems demonstrate that the evolutionary multi-objective approach is able to generate both accurate and understandable neural network models, which can be used for different purpose.},

This principle is implemented using observation generation in the Growing Spheres algorithm.

For example, safety-related applications for automation and control require that the correctness of the model must be ensured not only for the available data but for all possible input combinations. Thus, understanding what the model has learned and in particular how it will extrapolate to unseen data is a crucial concern. The paper discusses suitable learning methods for classification and regression. For classification problems, we review an approach based on an ensemble of nonlinear low-dimensional submodels, where each submodel is simple enough to be completely verified by domain experts. For regression problems, we review related approaches that try to achieve interpretability by using low-dimensional submodels (for instance, MARS and tree-growing methods). We compare them with symbolic regression, which is a different approach based on genetic algorithms. Finally, a novel approach is proposed for combining a symbolic regression model, which is shown to be easily interpretable, with a Gaussian Process. The combined model has an improved accuracy and provides error bounds in the sense that the deviation from the verified symbolic model is always kept below a defined limit.},

Therefore, we also look at ways to group the states and paths through the extracted FSM so as to get a smaller, easier to understand model of the neural network.

@inproceedings{weberInvestigatingTextualCaseBased2018,
 abstract = {This paper demonstrates how case-based reasoning (CBR) can be used for an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach to justify solutions produced by an opaque learning method (i.e., target method), particularly in the context of unstructured textual data. Our general hypothesis is twofold: (1) There exists patterns in the relationship between problems and solutions and there should be data or a body of knowledge that describes how problems and solutions relate; and (2) the identification, manipulation, and learning of such patterns through case features can help create and reuse explanations for solutions produced by the target method. When the target method relies on neural network architectures (e.g., deep learning), the resulting latent space (i.e., word embeddings) becomes useful for finding patterns and semantic relatedness in textual data. In the proposed approach, case problems are input-output pairs from the target method, and case solutions are explanations. We exemplify our approach by explaining recommended citations from Citeomatic - a multi-layer neural-network architecture from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Citation analysis is the body of knowledge that describes how query documents (i.e., inputs) relate to recommended citations (i.e., outputs). We build cases and similarity assessment to learn features that represent patterns between problems and solutions that can lead to the reuse of corresponding explanations. The illustrative implementation we present becomes an explanation-augmented citation recommender that targets human-computer trust.},

@inproceedings{zhangInterpretableNeuralModel2019,
 abstract = {Deep neural networks have achieved promising prediction performance, but are often criticized for the lack of interpretability, which is essential in many real-world applications such as health informatics and political science. Meanwhile, it has been observed that many shallow models, such as linear models or tree-based models, are fairly interpretable though not accurate enough. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we investigate how to fully take advantage of the interpretability of shallow models in neural networks. To this end, we propose a novel interpretable neural model with Interactive Stepwise Influence (ISI) framework. Specifically, in each iteration of the learning process, ISI interactively trains a shallow model with soft labels computed from a neural network, and the learned shallow model is then used to influence the neural network to gain interpretability. Thus ISI could achieve interpretability in three aspects: importance of features, impact of feature value changes, and adaptability of feature weights in the neural network learning process. Experiments on both synthetic and two real-world datasets demonstrate that ISI could generate reliable interpretation with respect to the three aspects, as well as preserve prediction accuracy by comparing with other state-of-the-art methods.},

 abstract = {This paper reviews recent studies in understanding neural-network representations and learning neural networks with interpretable/disentangled middle-layer representations. Although deep neural networks have exhibited superior performance in various tasks, interpretability is always Achilles' heel of deep neural networks. At present, deep neural networks obtain high discrimination power at the cost of a low interpretability of their black-box representations. We believe that high model interpretability may help people break several bottlenecks of deep learning, e.g., learning from a few annotations, learning via human\textendash{}computer communications at the semantic level, and semantically debugging network representations. We focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and revisit the visualization of CNN representations, methods of diagnosing representations of pre-trained CNNs, approaches for disentangling pre-trained CNN representations, learning of CNNs with disentangled representations, and middle-to-end learning based on model interpretability. Finally, we discuss prospective trends in explainable artificial intelligence.},
